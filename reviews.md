> "Before we started working with Cecilia we thought we had it all figured out. We weren't paying any interest on our credit cards and were saving a little. The problem was that we were living off [credit card float]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-12-06-Credit-Card-Float %}). If at any moment our income stopped coming in, we would find ourselves a month behind, unable to pay our credit card *and* pay for our current expenses. This was especially problematic because we were working towards my husband taking off the summer to spend it with our daughters. We had NO idea where our money was going each month. After a few months working we Cecilia, we eliminated our float, started saving toward those pesky "gotcha" items like repairs or annual fees (YUCK!) and were able to have my husband take 5 months off, stress-free, to spend with our girls and volunteer at school. We never would have been able to manage this with Cecilia and YNAB. There is no way we could thank her enough!"
