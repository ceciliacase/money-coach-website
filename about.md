### Saving the world one budget at a time!

I can help you create a positive and freeing relationship with money. Together, we will examine past behaviors, history and patterns related to your money relationship, not to create self-recriminations, but instead to find a path towards healing, and a more healthy relationship with money today and in the future.

I have wide ranging interests and experiences, including working as an Electrical Engineer, User Experience Designer, and now as a Money Coach and Potter. I have spent most of my working life getting into and out of debt in a never ending cycle. That is, until I found [You Need A Budget](http://www.youneedabudget.com) (YNAB) almost four years ago. YNAB helped me get out of debt and stay out, while also helping me align how I earn and spend money with my values.

I love working with people in all walks of life, but specialize in:
- Creatives and others with low income situations
- Those with highly variable incomes and situations
- Couples and the complex interaction between personal relationships and money relationships
- Uncoupling your money from another person, such as in divorce or separations
