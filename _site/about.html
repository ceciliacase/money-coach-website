<p>###Saving the world one budget at a time!
Cecilia has wide ranging interests and experiences, including working as an Electrical Engineer, User Experience Designer, and now as a Money Coach and Potter. She has spent most of her working life getting into and out of debt in a never ending cycle. That is, until she found You Need A Budget (YNAB) almost four years ago, the software and method that helped her get out of debt and stay out, while also helping her align how she earns and spends money with her values.</p>

<p>Cecilia can help you create a positive and freeing relationship with money. Together, you will examine past behaviors, history and patterns related to your money relationship, not to create self-recriminations, but instead to find a path towards healing, and a more healthy relationship with money today and in the future.</p>

<p>Cecilia loves working with people in all walks of life, but specializes in:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Creatives and others with low income situations</li>
  <li>Those with highly variable incomes and situations</li>
  <li>Couples and the complex interaction between personal relationships and money relationships</li>
  <li>Uncoupling your money from another person, such as in divorce or separations</li>
</ul>
