        <title>Why do most businesses fail? A perspective from a bookkeeper</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today is a big day for us here at Bountiful Money! I’m here to introduce you to Charissa Samco with Above LLC. She is the first guest poster on my blog. I met Charissa through a local bookkeeping networking group here in Portland called Portland Woodard Group, and we just hit it off! She has such a fantastic outlook towards the bookkeeping profession, and I love her kindness and dedication to the success of her clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last time we met, she made a startling and saddening observation - she has had to help several of her clients wrap up and close their businesses this last year, and she noticed a pattern. So if you are a small business owner, or thinking about starting your own business, I want you to read what she has to say!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I began bookkeeping because I love helping small business owners understand the financial story of their business. My clients allow me into a very intimate part of their lives – their money. Though I am only looking at their business accounts, I also get a feel for their personal financial practices. I am honored, and hold this trust with highest regard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These past few months as a bookkeeper have been some of the toughest I have ever encountered. Four of my clients have had to close their businesses. At first, I thought this reflected badly on my bookkeeping abilities, but after more reflection, I saw a pattern. All four businesses were profitable and their owners were good at what they did. However, three of the four owners struggled in their personal finances before starting their business and all four had accumulated large amounts of debt with high interest payments. All four had trouble keeping their business and personal finances separated and only two were able to take a wage from their business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Small Business Association (SBA) states that 30% of new businesses fail during the first two years of being open, 50% during the first five years and 66% during the first 10&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. I personally can attest that this is true, but I believe there is a solution. Here is the most important advice I can give to any small business owner or someone who wants to open a business. Are you listening? Are you ready to hear this? I promise, it will impact your business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;LEARN HOW TO MANAGE YOUR PERSONAL FINANCES!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever you do in your personal life &lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt; translate over to your business. I strongly believe that if any one of these business owners had met with a money coach and built a good relationship with money, their business would still be operating and they would be making enough money to support their families. A business is an asset. Like a house or a car. But a business is also a passion and it is hard to separate passion from practicality. The money side is the practical side and must be dealt with. The sooner you address your relationship with money, the better chance your business has of working for you and not against you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you Charissa for your amazing insights! Folks, if you want to talk to an amazing bookkeeper, &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:charissabsamco@gmail.com&quot;&gt;drop her a line&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Is Financial Independence Is Your Goal?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Financial Independence. Retire Early. If you’ve spent any time researching personal finance, you may have come across these terms, or the combined term - FIRE. When you first see them, they may seem far-fetched, or even completely unachievable. But today is Independence Day here in the United States, so let’s take a closer look and see how &lt;strong&gt;Financial&lt;/strong&gt; Independence might fit into our lives and our goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;retire-early&quot;&gt;Retire Early&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with “Retire Early.” When I first learned about the FIRE movement, I got stuck on the Retire Early part of the equation. How was it possible for people to retire in their 30’s and 40’s!? It seems absolutely preposterous. But if you read Mr. Money Mustache’s article &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/&quot;&gt;The Shockingly Simple Math Behind Early Retirement&lt;/a&gt; you’ll find that the trick is finding ways to increase your savings rate drastically. I won’t rehash the article here. I can’t possibly do it justice, it’s a beautiful article, and you should read it if you are at all interested in FIRE. But here is a simple comparison. If you save the normally recommended 15%, you will need to work 43 years to retire. But if you instead save 50% (Yes! It’s possible!) then it will only take you &lt;strong&gt;17&lt;/strong&gt; years to retire! Isn’t that amazing? Again, read the article to understand the theory, but I found it very convincing. And while I have chosen to pause my savings for a while to start up a business, I know how much I have gained in the past by upping my savings rate when I had a full-time job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;financial-independence&quot;&gt;Financial Independence&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even if you are convinced that retiring early is possible, sometimes there are other objections, often in the form of “I don’t &lt;strong&gt;want&lt;/strong&gt; to stop working!” That’s OK, you don’t have to. There are no rules here, and that is where “Financial Independence” comes in. Financial Independence simply means, “I am able to pay my expenses without &lt;em&gt;having&lt;/em&gt; to be employed or dependent on others.” So when you reach FI, you can simply keep on working. If you love what you are doing, and are feeling fulfilled, keep doing what you’re doing! It only means that if things go sour at work, you are fully capable of turning around and doing something else or quitting for a while without worry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you think? Do you think that Financial Independence and Retiring Early is a goal for you? Do you think it is possible in your life? And what would it mean for your life if you could FIRE?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Five Things That Make Debt Bad Or Good</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you heard the terms “bad debt” and “good debt”? Take a moment before you read on, and answer this question for yourself. What are the things that make debt “bad?” And what are the things that make debt “good?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve always hated the terms “bad debt” and “good debt” for a couple of reasons. One is, everyone’s definition is different, so we all often end up talking at cross purposes, and creating more confusion than is necessary. The other is I think it lays moral implications on top of something where it isn’t useful. That especially becomes a problem if it intensifies your feelings of guilt and shame around your money situation. So when you were thinking about what makes debt bad, what characteristics did you think of? Here are some things that came up in my mind:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;High interest rate&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;High risk (i.e. will I really be able to pay this off?)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Used to buy things that I didn’t need, or that I should have saved for first (i.e. consumer debt)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unsecured credit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when I think of “good” debt I thought of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Low interest rate&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Low risk&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mortgages&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Business loans&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Good debt to income ratio&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Leveraged debt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I look at these lists, I notice a couple of things. One, most of these are hard to quantify. Exactly how low does an interest rate have to be, for it to be “good?” And others had more to do with how they are used, not so much about the debt itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;is-this-really-a-useful-way-of-looking-at-debt&quot;&gt;Is this really a useful way of looking at debt?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d say that these criteria are so subjective that thinking of debt as good or bad really isn’t useful. And even more important, it implies that there are debts that you should feel guilty or ashamed to have. There are debts that are going to be harder to pay off or may have been used for purposes that you now think weren’t worth the risk of the debt, but feeling overwhelming feelings of guilt will only make it harder to pay off. The most important work when paying off debt often isn’t creating a debt plan. Often it is working through the feelings that the debt situation creates in you so that you can be truly ready to release your debt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;are-there-better-ways-of-thinking-of-debt&quot;&gt;Are there better ways of thinking of debt?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absolutely! Especially when thinking about taking on new debt, think about these things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is the debt secured or unsecured?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is the item being purchased worth the price and risk of the debt?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is the item going to generate consumer debt (i.e. credit cards) or going to generate something like a mortgage?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do you have a solid plan in place to pay off the debt? Realistically, how likely is it you will be able to stick to the plan.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is it high interest or low interest?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Will this debt help you generate money? Be &lt;em&gt;honest&lt;/em&gt; with this one. People misuse the word “investment” all the time. A car is not an investment. A rental property or business may be an investment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t matter what other people think is “good” debt or “bad” debt. What matters is whether this debt is useful to you, and this list can help you understand whether the debt is really worth it &lt;em&gt;for you&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Three Reasons People Don't Want to Budget</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Back when I was healing my own relationship with money, I encountered all sorts of resistance from others any time I mentioned budgeting. “Eh, I have enough money, I don’t need to track it.” Or on the other side: “I don’t have enough money to budget.” “Budgeting cramps my style,” or the reverse, “budgeting makes me feel bad about myself.” Now let me say, not everyone &lt;strong&gt;has&lt;/strong&gt; to budget. But I know that even for those that aren’t paycheck-to-paycheck, or deeply in debt, budgeting can still revolutionize personal finances for most people if done well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most budget methods &lt;strong&gt;are&lt;/strong&gt; restrictive, but don’t have to be that way! You can create budgets that are flexible, friendly, and aligned with your values. And if your budget is like that, many of the old excuses melt away!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;i-dont-have-enough-or-have-too-much-money-to-budget&quot;&gt;I don’t have enough (or have too much) money to budget&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonsense! Here’s a little secret - good budgets don’t track your money, they track your &lt;strong&gt;goals&lt;/strong&gt;. Do you have goals? Great! Then you can use a budget to maintain, track and attain your goals, at least as they pertain to money! Do you want to get out of paycheck-to-paycheck? Great budgets help with that. Do you want to make sure your money is making the maximum impact in your life? Fantastic! No matter what that looks like, whether it be retirement investing, saving for the luxuries in life, or creating a charitable foundation, budgeting is the first step!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;budgeting-makes-me-feel-bad-about-myself&quot;&gt;Budgeting makes me feel bad about myself&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now this one can be a hard thing. When you hold up your Money Mirror (i.e. look at your budget) it will reflect your current reality. And often we aren’t where we want to be, yet. It can be painful to look at. First of all, know that it’s true for everyone, especially when you’re starting your money mindset journey. Second of all, taking a clear look is the first step to healing your relationship with money, and creating a new reality that you are proud of. If you can get into the habit of taking a clear look at your financial situation, you will find that lots of other things start falling into place. I promise you, the pain will fade over time, to be replaced with freedom and control!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;i-dont-need-a-budget-im-doing-just-fine&quot;&gt;I don’t need a budget, I’m doing just fine&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This certainly is true for a lot of people. But I argue that clarity can make your currently comfortable financial situation and turn it into a &lt;em&gt;spectacular&lt;/em&gt; one. Take a moment and really look deep inside yourself. Are you getting everything accomplished that you would love to? Are you saving for every goal that would make you happy, as quickly as you would like to? Are you providing for your family in every way possible? Are you contributing money to every worthy charity and cause that is important to you? If you said no to any of these things, then a budget might help you get closer to these loftier goals that you have for yourself. Who knows, you may find yourself one day starting a charitable foundation of your own!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are tons of reasons why people don’t want to budget, but I think that the benefits far outweigh the emotional stress that it initially puts on you. What do you think, are you ready to give budgeting a try?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Pick One Thing and Work On It</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve worked with clients for a while now, and one thing I see over and over again is &lt;a href=&quot;/post/2019/01/16/Fight-The-Overwhelm.html&quot;&gt;overwhelm&lt;/a&gt;. Our lives are so complicated, juggling family, work, leisure time (if we’re lucky!) a second job or business, kids, unreasonable customers… I don’t need to tell you this, you already know it. And the more we pile on, the more we sink into the details and the harder it is to see the big picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we start flailing around. Work on something for five minutes, then spring to the next thing. Shout at our kids while we try to write an email to the boss. We’re proud of “multitasking” yet we’re aware that we don’t really give anything our full focus, so we have this suspicion that we’re really not doing our best work at anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh my gosh, I’m stressing myself out just typing this! But I’m trying to make a point - if you are chaotic with your time, it is probable you are chaotic with your money, too. You may be tossing dollars at things hoping that you can improve all parts of your life, but there is no focus, so nothing gets better. In fact, things may be getting more chaotic and hard to deal with. And one day you turn around and realize you have ten credit cards carrying balances, and what do you really have to show for it? Are you traveling the way you always wanted to? Do you have the retirement funds you know you should have? What have those dollars really accomplished for you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no simple solution for this, but I can tell you there is a simple first step: pick one thing and work on it. You can see an example of this idea in the Debt Avalanche (or its sister method “Debt Snowball”) method. If you don’t know what that is, allow me to give you a quick explanation. With Debt Avalanche, you list all of your debts. You write down the current balances, the interest rates, and the minimum payments for each. Then you arrange them in order of highest interest rate to lowest. Then, while you are paying for the minimums on all of the cards, you choose the debt at the top and throw all the extra money you have at it. When it is paid off, you take all of that money and go to the next debt on the list, and so on until they are all paid off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what you are doing is choosing one debt and creating a laser focus on it. All your efforts go towards paying off that one debt as fast as possible. And this has a couple of benefits. There is never any question of where extra money will go. You already know that, so you don’t have to expend any brainpower wondering or debating yourself. Also, it creates a clear reward path. As you pay off debts, you can see clearly how you are improving your situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can extend this technique to a lot of things. When you understand your &lt;a href=&quot;/post/2017/12/13/Bare-Bones-Number.html&quot;&gt;Bare Bones Number&lt;/a&gt;, you create this focus in your budget. You always know that you have to cover your rent, utilities, and groceries before anything else. That focus creates clarity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also use it for your savings. When you prioritize your savings goals, you can concentrate on the goals that will bring the most value to your life. And again, it creates clarity. You don’t need to wonder where that money is going, you’ve already made the decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t want you to think that this is a magic bullet. It takes an understanding of your own values to create clear plans for yourself. And it takes discipline to carry out those plans over the long term. And that is where the rubber meets the road. But I do want to tell you it is possible to create clarity from chaos in your money life, and this is a great way to start!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Origins of the Word &quot;Mortgage&quot;</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I ran across a little piece of information recently that stopped me in my tracks. Did you know that the word &lt;em&gt;mortgage&lt;/em&gt; translates to &lt;em&gt;death contract (or pledge)&lt;/em&gt; in French? Wow! If you are anything like me, that provokes a strong emotional reaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, debts are a powerful tool, like a sharp knife. It can be used as a tool, but it can also cause great damage and so they must be used cautiously and respect for the power they imply. And a mortgage is a good example of that power – the power to get you into a house now, while also creating a responsibility that will last for thirty years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve read that a mortgage is so called because the deal dies either when the debt is paid, or when payment fails, which makes some sense, and is a bit less dramatic than the implication. But I don’t think it is an accident that such dramatic language is used to describe a debt. Does the term “death contract” change how you feel about your debts?&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;In my last post I wrote a bit about changing our perceptions about the &lt;a href=&quot;/post/2019/03/13/Is-Debt-A-Universal-Constant.html&quot;&gt;inevitability of debt&lt;/a&gt;, but today I want to talk about a common problem people have with debt: Fear of looking at your debt. When you can’t look at your debt, it is impossible to &lt;strong&gt;do&lt;/strong&gt; anything about your debt! So let’s dive in and see why this fear exists, and what you can do about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;why-do-you-fear-debt&quot;&gt;Why do you fear debt?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first question to answer within yourself is &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; don’t you want to look at your debt situation? It can be a variety of reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fear that the amount is larger then you imagine&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fear of confronting past spending&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Anxiety of having to make a plan, or make changes in the present&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shame about any number of things, including the idea that somehow you should have known better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever it is, know three things: These emotions are powerful, they are understandable, and &lt;strong&gt;you are not alone&lt;/strong&gt;. But the first step to changing your life is taking a clear look at what you would like to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;take-a-clear-view&quot;&gt;Take a clear view&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you have some ideas of the powerful emotions surrounding your debt, I want you to take a moment. Close your eyes and say: “I am trying to protect myself by not looking at my debt. I understand that this is an attempt of my brain to keep me safe, but it is no longer serving me to avoid this. I am strong and powerful, and ready to understand where I stand.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I suggest taking out a piece of paper or your journal and start writing. Take a deep breath: how do you feel right now? What emotions are coming up, and where are they centered physically in your body? What is the strongest emotion?  And finally, write down something like this: “I forgive myself for avoiding my debt. I am a good person, and I am worthy of a debt-free life.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;break-it-down&quot;&gt;Break it down&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step is gathering the details of your debt information. That is beyond the scope of this article, but understanding a snapshot of your debt right now is the next step in creating a debt repayment plan. But before you do that, I want you to congratulate yourself for taking the steps to open yourself to your current financial situation. For many people, confronting their debt is the hardest part of improving their relationship with money. I’m so proud of you for taking this step!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;do-you-need-help&quot;&gt;Do you need help?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are struggling with this step or any other, I recommend you reach out to a Money Coach. We can help you with the strong emotions surrounding personal finance, and help you gain the tools you need to change how you relate to money. If you’d like to learn more, please reach out to me, I’m here to help!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Bank Of Mom And The Bank Of Dad</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As I have been working with the great people at &lt;a href=&quot;http://debt-payoff-planner.com&quot;&gt;Debt Payoff Planner&lt;/a&gt;, we have been having fun looking through data. One thing they pointed out to me was some interesting statistics relating to family loans. Often these loans are from a parent, which isn’t surprising, but something that did surprise me is some of them have an interest rate. In other words, the parents are charging their kids for their loans, which I found really surprising. Let’s dig into the data a bit more, and find out who lends their kids more often, Mom or Dad? And who charges more?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we tallied up the data for 10,000 loans we found that the percentage of loans that were from “Mom &amp;amp; Dad,” “Mom,” “Dad,” “Grandma,” or “Grandpa,” was about 2.4%. That number may skew a bit low because it would make sense for folks to not add family loans into their debt payoff calculator especially if they aren’t being charged interest. We also might have missed some that were labeled differently, so we don’t want to take this data as gospel. But let’s take a closer look at the data we do have. Who loaned the most often?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/MomandDadLoans1.svg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mom holds more than half of the loans, more than all the other family loans &lt;strong&gt;combined&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then looked a little closer, and we noticed something strange. Most of the loans are at 0%, but we did notice a scattering of loans with an interest rate - 11 loans in total! But when you look at them you’ll find that only one of the interest-bearing loans is from “Mom &amp;amp; Dad” (for &amp;lt;2%), one for Dad (for &amp;lt; 4%) and all the rest are from “Mom”! And not only that, Mom’s interest rates ranged all the way up to 20%! I have to say, I’m completely stunned by that news. I guess Mom really knows how to put the screws to their kids (I’m kidding! Just kidding!). We have no way of knowing why some of these parents are charging such a high interest rate, but it does put a bit of a spin on what I thought I knew about family loans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;paying-off-family-loans&quot;&gt;Paying off family loans&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is all very interesting, but the most important question may be: when you have a loan from family, when should you pay it off?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a great question, and the answer is often very personal. But there are two major things to consider: The math, and the relationship. If you look strictly at the math, the vast majority of family loans have no interest rate at all. If your loan is like that, it is tempting to shuffle it to the bottom of the list, below credit cards, car loans, and even mortgages and student loans. And if it was purely a mathematical decision, that would make sense. The loan isn’t costing you any more money, so it makes sense to concentrate on all of the other loans you have that &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; costing you money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it isn’t just a mathematical decision, it is a personal relationship decision, too. While many family lenders are perfectly happy to wait for a long time to see their money back, lent money can create a strain on relationships. As you are considering how to build your debt repayment plan, seriously consider the damage it may be doing to your relationship. If you feel that it is going to cause lasting harm, you might decide to put it higher on the list. But also consider what would make the situation better for both parties. Perhaps paying a minimal amount, but doing so regularly would show how serious you are about paying the money, and may lessen the tension without requiring you to put your credit card repayment plan on hold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or you may decide to hold a meeting with your parents, and have an open and frank discussion about your situation. Communicating your situation and plans with them, and then bringing them into the decision-making process may also be a really helpful step. But always consider, if this money is really standing between you and a good relationship with your parents, perhaps it is time to get serious about prioritizing your loan with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no right or wrong way of paying back family, but taking a look at the practical method, then examining how it will affect everyone involved and making sure there is good communication will make sure you find the best solution for you and your family.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Is Debt a Universal Constant?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;“I’ll be in debt until I die.”
“Everyone is in debt.”
“I’ll always have a car loan. I can’t afford to buy a car with cash!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Debt is a universal constant, never to be escaped and never to be changed, like Death and Taxes, right? Over the years, I’ve noticed that there seems to be a large group of people out there that accept debt as a constant in their lives that can never be eliminated. “Well, that’s just the way it is, right? I have to get a loan to get a car. And by the time I pay this one off, I’ll need a new car, with a new loan.” But is that really true? Is debt really inevitable?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I hear people talk this way, it brings up a few things in my mind. Firstly, there is a sense of defeat in this sort of talk. It implies that you have already given up on a debt-free lifestyle. Not only that, there is an implication that you can’t even try, because it’s quite simply impossible. Sometimes it makes sense that they’ve come to this conclusion - it comes from looking around you and seeing everyone you know in debt. It’s a small step to think that if everyone you know is in debt, it must be impossible to be debt-free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But thinking like this closes off your options. You’ve already decided that you’re going to fail, sometimes even before you’ve tried! Don’t get me wrong, I am not trying to minimize the pain of being in debt. Having five or six figures of debt is absolutely a tough row to hoe. Getting out of debt is truly one of the hardest things that most people do with regard to their money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But once you get out of debt, it is absolutely possible to &lt;em&gt;stay&lt;/em&gt; debt-free. You can take me for an example. I started my adult life by going to college. During that time I started accumulating student loans. I don’t remember anymore what the original amount was exactly, but I think it was about $40,000 all told. I was lucky that as soon as I was out of college my husband and I both got a good paying jobs. But I also got a credit card, and while I didn’t use it much, I did put a little on in it, and sometimes the balance would inch up a bit. I didn’t make my student loans a priority, so they lingered for years, accumulating more interest then was really necessary if I had concentrated on paying them off. Instead, my husband and I got car loans, and we bought a house. We were always pretty sensible, keeping the loan amounts low, and taking advantage of our good credit to keep the interest rates pretty low. But we weren’t paying attention to our finances, so credit card debt would creep up, then we’d pay them off, just to right back to using them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started getting serious about repairing my relationship with money, I could see that getting out of debt was the first step. But I also realized that I wanted to stay out of debt. I knew that our mortgage wasn’t too bad of a debt, and had a small interest rate, so I decided to pay off all our student loans, car loans, and credit card debt, and then I resolved to never use debt unless it was a conscious decision that made financial sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After paying off all of our loans in 2015, we only took out loans twice. Once to buy a boat, that is now completely paid for, and once to lease an electric car (yes, leases are loans!). They were both thoughtful decisions that worked to our advantage and were relatively low risk loans. Since my divorce, we sold the house, and I have been debt free ever since then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how do I do it? I make decisions that make debt the decision of last resort. I always want to remember there are often alternatives to using debt. For example check out this awesome diagram:
&lt;img src=&quot;http://longliveirony.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/03SL2012BuyerarchyofNeeds.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Buyerarchy of Needs&quot; /&gt;
The idea is you work from bottom to top, so buying new is always your last option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another question I always ask myself: “Can I wait to buy this until I have the money for it?” Sometimes, like with clothing or household goods the answer is an easy yes. Sometimes, like with a house, then answer is often an automatic no. But it is always good to ask the question and challenge yourself to find creative ways of getting what you need without going into debt. Buying a car is a good example. Most people automatically assume they will have to buy a car with a loan. But do you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; need a loan? Would an older car that is in good shape do you just as well? And if you need a loan, can you put a &lt;strong&gt;giant&lt;/strong&gt; down payment on it, so that you can pay it off as quickly as possible?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this article has helped you see that there are often alternatives to using debt, and that debt is not a given in this world. There are many people who live debt-free, and you can, too! One last thing I want to say; being debt-free is &lt;strong&gt;worth it&lt;/strong&gt;. I have never been so stress free in my life. It can be annoying to not always have the nicest, shiniest thing. But the freedom of knowing I don’t owe anyone else anything is so much better than a spangly new phone, or a giant SUV.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Three Pillars to a Healthy Relationship with Money</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Last post, I talked about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bountifulmoneycoach.com/post/2019/01/30/Three-Symptoms-Of-Money-Issues.html&quot;&gt;the three symptoms of money issues&lt;/a&gt;. If you think you have a problem with your money, the next question becomes, what can you do about it? So today I’d like to talk a little about the three pillars to concentrate on when healing your relationship with money. This will give you a good base to start understanding the steps you’ll need to take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the time that I took to heal my own relationship with money, I developed a theory that there are three aspects to a relationship with money that must all be addressed in order to create a healthy and stable relationship with your money. If you don’t have all three pillars in place, you will find it difficult to truly change how you work with money. So what are those pillars?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;heal-your-old-money-stories&quot;&gt;Heal your old money stories&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, and possibly the most important pillar is understanding and healing your old money stories. What is a money story? It is that little voice in your head that was written a long time ago and tells you how to feel about money. Do you ever hear a little voice in your head that says one of these things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Rich people are greedy”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Poor people are lazy”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“I’m terrible with money”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“I’m not good with numbers, that must be why I can’t hold onto money”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Spending money on myself is self-indulgent”
And of course, there are thousands more stories you could be telling yourself. Some might even be good stories:&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“I’m worthy of having a good job that pays me well.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“I can balance saving money with enjoying my life now.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever stories you have in your head, they probably developed when you were a child. They came from your parents, teachers, and peers. Unfortunately, they may not have always been the stories those people &lt;strong&gt;meant&lt;/strong&gt; to be telling you. But when you are a kid, you were a sponge. You saw everything, and incorporated them into your worldview. And because you probably did’t have a solid financial education, you never had a chance to examine those stories and assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first pillar of healing your relationship with money is to take out those old stories and examine them. Where did you get these stories? And did are they still useful to you, or are they actually harming your ability to make and spend money in a satisfying and rewarding way? And if not, what would be a better story that would serve you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;learn-techniques-to-manage-your-money-with-joy&quot;&gt;Learn techniques to manage your money with joy&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Healing your emotional relationship with money is very important, and is often neglected by financial experts. But along with healing your emotions around money, it is important to learn a set of tools and techniques that will help you manage money. Healing your emotions without action isn’t going to be that helpful to you in the long term. So learning peaceful and useful ways of holding up your Money Mirror (which is what I call budgeting), developing a debt repayment plan that makes sense for your life, and setting up good savings strategies are all very important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;establish-your-new-money-groove&quot;&gt;Establish your new money groove&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, now that you have a good relationship with money, and you have the tools to maintain that relationship, it is very important to groove in new money habits. A good relationship with money needs to be maintained over time. There is no reason for it to be a fight against yourself to maintain your new relationship with money, though. These habits are going to feel more and more natural over time. As you keep practicing your healthy relationship with money, and utilizing techniques that help you achieve your life goals, you will find that the habits will start falling into place most of the time. But it is important to keep checking in with yourself: Are you happy with your money? Are you feeling stressed out, or peaceful and accomplished?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;pulling-it-all-together&quot;&gt;Pulling it all together&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you work through these three pillars, you may start seeing that the three pillars are interconnected. Working on your emotions may open up techniques or tools that would have previously made no sense. Or learning a new tool may make it easier for you to develop better habits. So as you can see, working on your relationship with money isn’t a linear thing, and there is no quick fix. It, like many things, are made up of a series of baby steps that lead you to your goal.&lt;/p&gt;
