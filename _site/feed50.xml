        <title>Are You Afraid To Look At Your Debt?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In my last post I wrote a bit about changing our perceptions about the &lt;a href=&quot;/index.php/archives/2019-03-13-Is-Debt-A-Universal-Constant&quot;&gt;inevitability of debt&lt;/a&gt;, but today I want to talk about a common problem people have with debt: Fear of looking at your debt. When you can’t look at your debt, it is impossible to &lt;strong&gt;do&lt;/strong&gt; anything about your debt! So let’s dive in and see why this fear exists, and what you can do about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;why-do-you-fear-debt&quot;&gt;Why do you fear debt?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first question to answer within yourself is &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; don’t you want to look at your debt situation? It can be a variety of reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fear that the amount is larger then you imagine&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fear of confronting past spending&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Anxiety of having to make a plan, or make changes in the present&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shame about any number of things, including the idea that somehow you should have known better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever it is, know three things: These emotions are powerful, they are understandable, and &lt;strong&gt;you are not alone&lt;/strong&gt;. But the first step to changing your life is taking a clear look at what you would like to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;take-a-clear-view&quot;&gt;Take a clear view&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you have some ideas of the powerful emotions surrounding your debt, I want you to take a moment. Close your eyes and say: “I am trying to protect myself by not looking at my debt. I understand that this is an attempt of my brain to keep me safe, but it is no longer serving me to avoid this. I am strong and powerful, and ready to understand where I stand.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I suggest taking out a piece of paper or your journal and start writing. Take a deep breath: how do you feel right now? What emotions are coming up, and where are they centered physically in your body? What is the strongest emotion?  And finally, write down something like this: “I forgive myself for avoiding my debt. I am a good person, and I am worthy of a debt-free life.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;break-it-down&quot;&gt;Break it down&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step is gathering the details of your debt information. That is beyond the scope of this article, but understanding a snapshot of your debt right now is the next step in creating a debt repayment plan. But before you do that, I want you to congratulate yourself for taking the steps to open yourself to your current financial situation. For many people, confronting their debt is the hardest part of improving their relationship with money. I’m so proud of you for taking this step!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;do-you-need-help&quot;&gt;Do you need help?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are struggling with this step or any other, I recommend you reach out to a Money Coach. We can help you with the strong emotions surrounding personal finance, and help you gain the tools you need to change how you relate to money. If you’d like to learn more, please reach out to me, I’m here to help!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Bank Of Mom And The Bank Of Dad</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As I have been working with the great people at &lt;a href=&quot;http://debt-payoff-planner.com&quot;&gt;Debt Payoff Planner&lt;/a&gt;, we have been having fun looking through data. One thing they pointed out to me was some interesting statistics relating to family loans. Often these loans are from a parent, which isn’t surprising, but something that did surprise me is some of them have an interest rate. In other words, the parents are charging their kids for their loans, which I found really surprising. Let’s dig into the data a bit more, and find out who lends their kids more often, Mom or Dad? And who charges more?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we tallied up the data for 10,000 loans we found that the percentage of loans that were from “Mom &amp;amp; Dad,” “Mom,” “Dad,” “Grandma,” or “Grandpa,” was about 2.4%. That number may skew a bit low because it would make sense for folks to not add family loans into their debt payoff calculator especially if they aren’t being charged interest. We also might have missed some that were labeled differently, so we don’t want to take this data as gospel. But let’s take a closer look at the data we do have. Who loaned the most often?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/MomandDadLoans1.svg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mom holds more than half of the loans, more than all the other family loans &lt;strong&gt;combined&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then looked a little closer, and we noticed something strange. Most of the loans are at 0%, but we did notice a scattering of loans with an interest rate - 11 loans in total! But when you look at them you’ll find that only one of the interest-bearing loans is from “Mom &amp;amp; Dad” (for &amp;lt;2%), one for Dad (for &amp;lt; 4%) and all the rest are from “Mom”! And not only that, Mom’s interest rates ranged all the way up to 20%! I have to say, I’m completely stunned by that news. I guess Mom really knows how to put the screws to their kids (I’m kidding! Just kidding!). We have no way of knowing why some of these parents are charging such a high interest rate, but it does put a bit of a spin on what I thought I knew about family loans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;paying-off-family-loans&quot;&gt;Paying off family loans&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is all very interesting, but the most important question may be: when you have a loan from family, when should you pay it off?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a great question, and the answer is often very personal. But there are two major things to consider: The math, and the relationship. If you look strictly at the math, the vast majority of family loans have no interest rate at all. If your loan is like that, it is tempting to shuffle it to the bottom of the list, below credit cards, car loans, and even mortgages and student loans. And if it was purely a mathematical decision, that would make sense. The loan isn’t costing you any more money, so it makes sense to concentrate on all of the other loans you have that &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; costing you money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it isn’t just a mathematical decision, it is a personal relationship decision, too. While many family lenders are perfectly happy to wait for a long time to see their money back, lent money can create a strain on relationships. As you are considering how to build your debt repayment plan, seriously consider the damage it may be doing to your relationship. If you feel that it is going to cause lasting harm, you might decide to put it higher on the list. But also consider what would make the situation better for both parties. Perhaps paying a minimal amount, but doing so regularly would show how serious you are about paying the money, and may lessen the tension without requiring you to put your credit card repayment plan on hold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or you may decide to hold a meeting with your parents, and have an open and frank discussion about your situation. Communicating your situation and plans with them, and then bringing them into the decision-making process may also be a really helpful step. But always consider, if this money is really standing between you and a good relationship with your parents, perhaps it is time to get serious about prioritizing your loan with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no right or wrong way of paying back family, but taking a look at the practical method, then examining how it will affect everyone involved and making sure there is good communication will make sure you find the best solution for you and your family.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Is Debt a Universal Constant?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;“I’ll be in debt until I die.”
“Everyone is in debt.”
“I’ll always have a car loan. I can’t afford to buy a car with cash!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Debt is a universal constant, never to be escaped and never to be changed, like Death and Taxes, right? Over the years, I’ve noticed that there seems to be a large group of people out there that accept debt as a constant in their lives that can never be eliminated. “Well, that’s just the way it is, right? I have to get a loan to get a car. And by the time I pay this one off, I’ll need a new car, with a new loan.” But is that really true? Is debt really inevitable?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I hear people talk this way, it brings up a few things in my mind. Firstly, there is a sense of defeat in this sort of talk. It implies that you have already given up on a debt-free lifestyle. Not only that, there is an implication that you can’t even try, because it’s quite simply impossible. Sometimes it makes sense that they’ve come to this conclusion - it comes from looking around you and seeing everyone you know in debt. It’s a small step to think that if everyone you know is in debt, it must be impossible to be debt-free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But thinking like this closes off your options. You’ve already decided that you’re going to fail, sometimes even before you’ve tried! Don’t get me wrong, I am not trying to minimize the pain of being in debt. Having five or six figures of debt is absolutely a tough row to hoe. Getting out of debt is truly one of the hardest things that most people do with regard to their money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But once you get out of debt, it is absolutely possible to &lt;em&gt;stay&lt;/em&gt; debt-free. You can take me for an example. I started my adult life by going to college. During that time I started accumulating student loans. I don’t remember anymore what the original amount was exactly, but I think it was about $40,000 all told. I was lucky that as soon as I was out of college my husband and I both got a good paying jobs. But I also got a credit card, and while I didn’t use it much, I did put a little on in it, and sometimes the balance would inch up a bit. I didn’t make my student loans a priority, so they lingered for years, accumulating more interest then was really necessary if I had concentrated on paying them off. Instead, my husband and I got car loans, and we bought a house. We were always pretty sensible, keeping the loan amounts low, and taking advantage of our good credit to keep the interest rates pretty low. But we weren’t paying attention to our finances, so credit card debt would creep up, then we’d pay them off, just to right back to using them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started getting serious about repairing my relationship with money, I could see that getting out of debt was the first step. But I also realized that I wanted to stay out of debt. I knew that our mortgage wasn’t too bad of a debt, and had a small interest rate, so I decided to pay off all our student loans, car loans, and credit card debt, and then I resolved to never use debt unless it was a conscious decision that made financial sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After paying off all of our loans in 2015, we only took out loans twice. Once to buy a boat, that is now completely paid for, and once to lease an electric car (yes, leases are loans!). They were both thoughtful decisions that worked to our advantage and were relatively low risk loans. Since my divorce, we sold the house, and I have been debt free ever since then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how do I do it? I make decisions that make debt the decision of last resort. I always want to remember there are often alternatives to using debt. For example check out this awesome diagram:
&lt;img src=&quot;http://longliveirony.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/03SL2012BuyerarchyofNeeds.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Buyerarchy of Needs&quot; /&gt;
The idea is you work from bottom to top, so buying new is always your last option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another question I always ask myself: “Can I wait to buy this until I have the money for it?” Sometimes, like with clothing or household goods the answer is an easy yes. Sometimes, like with a house, then answer is often an automatic no. But it is always good to ask the question and challenge yourself to find creative ways of getting what you need without going into debt. Buying a car is a good example. Most people automatically assume they will have to buy a car with a loan. But do you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; need a loan? Would an older car that is in good shape do you just as well? And if you need a loan, can you put a &lt;strong&gt;giant&lt;/strong&gt; down payment on it, so that you can pay it off as quickly as possible?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this article has helped you see that there are often alternatives to using debt, and that debt is not a given in this world. There are many people who live debt-free, and you can, too! One last thing I want to say; being debt-free is &lt;strong&gt;worth it&lt;/strong&gt;. I have never been so stress free in my life. It can be annoying to not always have the nicest, shiniest thing. But the freedom of knowing I don’t owe anyone else anything is so much better than a spangly new phone, or a giant SUV.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Three Pillars to a Healthy Relationship with Money</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Last post, I talked about &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/post/2019/01/30/Three-Symptoms-Of-Money-Issues.html&quot;&gt;the three symptoms of money issues&lt;/a&gt;. If you think you have a problem with your money, the next question becomes, what can you do about it? So today I’d like to talk a little about the three pillars to concentrate on when healing your relationship with money. This will give you a good base to start understanding the steps you’ll need to take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the time that I took to heal my own relationship with money, I developed a theory that there are three aspects to a relationship with money that must all be addressed in order to create a healthy and stable relationship with your money. If you don’t have all three pillars in place, you will find it difficult to truly change how you work with money. So what are those pillars?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;heal-your-old-money-stories&quot;&gt;Heal your old money stories&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, and possibly the most important pillar is understanding and healing your old money stories. What is a money story? It is that little voice in your head that was written a long time ago and tells you how to feel about money. Do you ever hear a little voice in your head that says one of these things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Rich people are greedy”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Poor people are lazy”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“I’m terrible with money”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“I’m not good with numbers, that must be why I can’t hold onto money”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Spending money on myself is self-indulgent”
And of course, there are thousands more stories you could be telling yourself. Some might even be good stories:&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“I’m worthy of having a good job that pays me well.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“I can balance saving money with enjoying my life now.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever stories you have in your head, they probably developed when you were a child. They came from your parents, teachers, and peers. Unfortunately, they may not have always been the stories those people &lt;strong&gt;meant&lt;/strong&gt; to be telling you. But when you are a kid, you were a sponge. You saw everything, and incorporated them into your worldview. And because you probably did’t have a solid financial education, you never had a chance to examine those stories and assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first pillar of healing your relationship with money is to take out those old stories and examine them. Where did you get these stories? And did are they still useful to you, or are they actually harming your ability to make and spend money in a satisfying and rewarding way? And if not, what would be a better story that would serve you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;learn-techniques-to-manage-your-money-with-joy&quot;&gt;Learn techniques to manage your money with joy&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Healing your emotional relationship with money is very important, and is often neglected by financial experts. But along with healing your emotions around money, it is important to learn a set of tools and techniques that will help you manage money. Healing your emotions without action isn’t going to be that helpful to you in the long term. So learning peaceful and useful ways of holding up your Money Mirror (which is what I call budgeting), developing a debt repayment plan that makes sense for your life, and setting up good savings strategies are all very important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;establish-your-new-money-groove&quot;&gt;Establish your new money groove&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, now that you have a good relationship with money, and you have the tools to maintain that relationship, it is very important to groove in new money habits. A good relationship with money needs to be maintained over time. There is no reason for it to be a fight against yourself to maintain your new relationship with money, though. These habits are going to feel more and more natural over time. As you keep practicing your healthy relationship with money, and utilizing techniques that help you achieve your life goals, you will find that the habits will start falling into place most of the time. But it is important to keep checking in with yourself: Are you happy with your money? Are you feeling stressed out, or peaceful and accomplished?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;pulling-it-all-together&quot;&gt;Pulling it all together&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you work through these three pillars, you may start seeing that the three pillars are interconnected. Working on your emotions may open up techniques or tools that would have previously made no sense. Or learning a new tool may make it easier for you to develop better habits. So as you can see, working on your relationship with money isn’t a linear thing, and there is no quick fix. It, like many things, are made up of a series of baby steps that lead you to your goal.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Five Steps to Thrive with Variable Income</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Everyone, I’m so excited that I have been accepted to write a blog post for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.womenwithmoxie.com&quot;&gt;Women With Moxie&lt;/a&gt;! You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.womenwithmoxie.com/five-steps-to-thrive-with-variable-income/&quot;&gt;read it there&lt;/a&gt; and I have reposted here!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had been working on my own relationship with money for a few years before I decided to become a Money Coach and start my own business. I had been through highs and lows, made mistakes, and had personal triumphs. I felt pretty good about my relationship with money and was out of debt, so I figured starting my own business wouldn’t change things that much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was wrong!
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was budgeting with a stable salary, I had to deal with varying expenses, nasty surprises, and changing priorities all the time. But when I became a small business owner, everything became variable, both coming in and going out. I didn’t know how much money I was going to have to budget with, so how could I make decisions at all? What could I do to tame the wild bronco ride of variable income? Well, I needed to turn my variable income into a stable income. It sounds easy to say it, but of course, it was harder than it sounded. It took me a while, but I created a reliable system that I use today that helps me budget consistently and reliably. And today I’m going to share with you the five steps I took to master my variable income as a business owner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Separate your business and personal accounts&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;All your income goes into the business account&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Determine the variability of your income&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Build a buffer in your business account&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pay yourself a stable income&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look at the steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;separate-your-business-and-personal-accounts&quot;&gt;Separate your business and personal accounts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may have already heard this. While separating your personal and business accounts is often touted as a good idea for IRS purposes, there is another reason that is more relevant here - when you separate your personal money from your business money, you can get clarity. When all the business money is in one place you can see much more clearly how your business is really doing. And you can more easily budget your personal money if it is isolated from the fluctuations of the business. And that is the key here for those with variable income. You want to isolate the variability in one place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;all-your-income-goes-into-the-business-account&quot;&gt;All your income goes into the business account&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have separated the two accounts, then you need to make sure that all of your income goes into your business account. Again, we’re striving to isolate that variable income, so it is easier to understand it and manage it. This step isn’t complicated, but it is important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;determine-the-variability-of-your-income&quot;&gt;Determine the variability of your income&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you have clarity between your personal and business money, you can use that clarity to really understand the variability of your income situation. For those of you with a little variability in your income, I suggest you look back at your income for the past 6 months. If you have extreme variability or seasonal variability, like realtors or owners of construction businesses, it is probably best to look at the last 12 months of income. List your income for the six months, and find these numbers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Highest month&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lowest month&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Average of all the months&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you have a bit of an idea of how much your business income really varies. Now, just because these were your numbers for the last few months doesn’t mean that is what will happen in the next six months, but you’re not looking for a perfect number here. You’re just trying to get an idea of the ebb and flow of your business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, you are going to want to do the same with your business expenses. If you have fairly consistent business expenses, you’ll be able to just use one number and subtract it from the high, low and average income to get what you have available to send to your personal account. But if it is more variable, it may be a little harder to figure out. When in doubt, I recommend overestimating your guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;build-a-buffer-in-your-business-account&quot;&gt;Build a buffer in your business account&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you can use that information to build an Income Buffer. An Income Buffer is a small amount of money that allows you to even out the income you send to your personal account. That money will help you stay out of debt in the low months, and keep you from overspending in the flush months. So let’s say your lowest month was a net of $2000, your highest was $5000, and your average was $3500. You want to shoot for sending $3500 to your personal account every month, no matter how good or bad your revenue was this month. You will use that $3500 every month to pay all of your personal expenses. The difference between your lowest number and your average is $1500, so now you know that you need to build a buffer of at least $1500 to survive a low month of $2000 without reducing your personal spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;pay-yourself-a-stable-income&quot;&gt;Pay yourself a stable income&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the good part! When you’ve built that Buffer, you can start using it to stabilize your income. Let’s say the next month, you make a net of $3000. You’ll pull $500 from your income buffer so that you can still pay yourself $3500. If the next month you make $4200, you can put all but $3500 of it back into your Income Buffer. Remember, all of these numbers are after your business expenses (and taxes!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you have a stabilized income, starting to budget your personal expenses becomes so much easier. You’ll find that you can plan for the future much easier, and you won’t have those horrible months where you have to tighten your belt to almost nothing, or worse, start taking on debt. Instead, you will have a smooth, dependable income, every month!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What Are The Top Three Symptoms Of Money Issues?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Before I get started with my article this week, I’d like to ask you to please forward these articles to anyone you think might benefit from them. I want to spread the word that a truly healthy relationship with money is possible!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we are working with a subject as important as money, it can sometimes be hard to even know if you have a problem. How can you tell if you are doing well, or if there really is something that you could do better? In this article I want introduce the top three symptoms that can help you identify if you need to improve your relationship with money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;feelings-of-guilt-or-shame-around-your-spending-decisions&quot;&gt;Feelings of guilt or shame around your spending decisions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you spend emotionally? Do you horde money because you’re afraid to make the wrong decision? Feeling guilt or shame around your money is your body and mind telling you that there is something wrong. I like to say that guilt and shame is often a symptom of a lack of alignment of your money decisions and your life values. The further your spending is away from your fundamental values, the stronger the feelings of guilt and shame will be. As I work with clients, we do a lot of work on releasing guilt and shame both by exploring their money stories as well as working to more deeply understand their values and realigning your spending with those values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But at this stage, it can be a useful indicator: If you feel guilt and shame around money, it probably means your relationship with money is currently unhealthy. The next step is become forgiving to yourself, while understanding what your current money situation is, so that you can make decisions that are more aligned with your values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-paycheck-to-paycheck-cycle&quot;&gt;The paycheck-to-paycheck cycle&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahhhhh, the paycheck-to-paycheck cycle. For those of you that have experienced it or it’s bruiser cousin the debt-spiral, I probably don’t need to say very much here. If you are just squeaking by every month, if you are relieved to see your paycheck come in every month, or you know that a delay of even a few days could sink your whole financial house of cards, then you already know how stressful and nerve-wracking being in this situation is. And the thing is, while it is sometimes a problem with too low income, it is just as often an issue with over-spending, or (here it is again!) lack of clarity about spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you find yourself in a paycheck-to-paycheck cycle, often the first step is getting clarity. I’m not trying to say it is easy. I know from personal experience that it is &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; much easier to say than do. But I can tell you, it is possible to do!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;lack-of-clarity&quot;&gt;Lack of clarity&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you know how much debt you have? Do you know the minimum you need to spend each month to survive? Do you know how much you are worth? If you have a business, are your business finances separated from your personal finances?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a lack of clarity surrounding your money is my number one symptom of an unhealthy relationship with money. It indicates that you might be pushing away your finances, and not looking deeply into whether you have a plan in place that is working for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-can-you-do-about-it&quot;&gt;What can you do about it?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being able to look at your finances clearly is also the first step to healing your relationship with money! You might be surprised how gaining clarity on your money will actually bring you relief from money stress. Even if the overall picture is not what you hoped, just knowing helps you understand what you can do to bring yourself forward to the financial goals you have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step is knowing you want to improve how you work with money! Now that you know, you can narrow it down a bit. Do you need to focus on debt? Do you want to stop compulsive spending? Do you want to let go of guilt and shame and have a healthy relationship with money? Once you know what the first step is, you can start working on healing your relationship with money, one day at a time. In an upcoming article, I’m going to talk about my philosophy for a healthy relationship with money. Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Fight the Overwhelm</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I hear a lot of different emotions when I talk with my clients. Money is so connected to most parts of our lives that it is actually very difficult to separate it from how we conduct our lives, and the events that go on in our lives. We work to get money, which we then turn around and spend, both on things that are deeply important to us, and on things that are of almost no importance at all. And sometimes that wheel gets to be going faster and faster, until we feel like we might fly right off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;That’s overwhelm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because our money lives are so complex, it can start feeling like we are juggling grumpy gerbils (Not that I would &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; do something like that!) and we’re just trying to stay ahead of the next disaster, or the next surprise in our lives. And what is one of the biggest contributors to this feeling of overwhelm?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest contributor to feeling overwhelmed, it not knowing the outcomes to a situation will be bad or good, and not knowing what that might look like. So let’s take a look at a semi-fictionalized example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jane graduated three years ago, and she has big student loans. She hates the feeling of debt, so she has mostly pushed it out of her mind, but sometimes, the fear comes cropping up. How will she every pay them off? What if she needs help, who can she ask? And most of all, she’s even lost track of how much she has in student loan debt, which spirals the feeling of overwhelm into the stratosphere. It can be hard, but sometimes even the act of finding out how “bad” the bad situation is can calm the emotions. When she finally worked up the nerve to call her loan company, she finds out it is $15,000. Well, that is bad of course, but it could be much worse and now that she knew, she could start putting a plan in place, one that put her in the drivers seat, and will get her out of debt over time. She also told them over the phone that she was getting control of her loans, and is there anything they would recommend she do to get into good standing with the company. They gave her several useful tips that helped calm her even further. Even though she hadn’t paid a single cent since the phone call, she already felt better, because she knew where she stood, and she was ready to create a usable plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have all felt overwhelm in our lives, especially around finances. The most important step to releasing that feeling is to start getting true clarity on your situation. Remember, managing your money is not about guilt and shame for the past. It is about starting from right now, and finding clarity and control. You can do this!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My yearly review</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned last year, I’m not big on New Year Resolutions. But making goals and reviewing them is very important and can really clarify your values and your money situation. The past few years, I’ve done an informal, high level yearly review of my financial situation, and it’s really helped me gain a perspective of how my goals change over time. I’d like to share with you my 2018 review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is my list of financial goals for this last year:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be making enough money with my own business to sustain myself at my &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/post/2017/12/13/Bare-Bones-Number.html&quot;&gt;Bare Bones Number&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;And if I haven’t achieved that, have a part-time in a related field to continue growing and expanding professionally.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stay debt-free!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Contribute to my retirement funds&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have a retirement portfolio worth $xyz. [Author note: I have removed the amounts for this goal, but I’ll talk about whether or not I have achieved it, and how it worked for me]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how does this list compare to where I stand right now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;be-making-enough-money-with-my-own-business-to-sustain-myself&quot;&gt;Be making enough money with my own business to sustain myself&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOT YET. This has been my number one job this year. But I look back and I don’t even recognize myself. I had no one to look to as a role model for being a small business owner. Neither of my parents owned a business, and I don’t have friends that own their own business, either. It has been a crazy steep learning curve, but I now consider myself a business owner and entrepreneur. I am not yet in the black. But I am proud of myself for two things; I have not gone into debt while starting my business, and I have learned so much this past year that I actually feel like a business owner! I know how to market and sell in a way that is in alignment with my values, and how to stand in my self-worth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;and-if-i-havent-achieved-that-have-a-part-time-in-a-related-field-to-continue-growing-and-expanding-professionally&quot;&gt;And if I haven’t achieved that, have a part-time in a related field to continue growing and expanding professionally&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOPE, I didn’t do this. Even though I haven’t quite achieved point one yet, I am on track to do so. I want to make sure every ounce of my energy is going into that goal right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stay-debt-free&quot;&gt;Stay debt-free!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YES! I have done this so far! This is a huge achievement for a small business owner, let me tell you. There is no shame in getting a business loan, and if I end up needing one, I’ll certainly get one, but I really want to make a go of this without debt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;contribute-to-my-retirement-funds&quot;&gt;Contribute to my retirement funds&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOPE! I have set this aside until the first goal is achieved. I am ok with this because I am already ahead of the game with retirement investing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;have-a-retirement-portfolio-worth-xyz&quot;&gt;Have a retirement portfolio worth $xyz&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOT QUITE. Because I haven’t been contributing, and the market hasn’t been stellar, I think it’s probably only a little over where I was last year. But seeing as I’m quite a bit ahead for my age, and I’m committed to changing the trajectory of my life, I’m totally OK with letting this one ride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-else-happened-this-year&quot;&gt;What else happened this year?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;My ex-husband and I still have a lovely relationship. This is so important to me, and we’ve both invested a lot of time and energy in being supportive of one another in our new quests and achievements. He’s been one of my biggest cheerleaders, and I’m so proud of his new job in the space industry! I know that is the fulfillment of a childhood dream for him.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I invested in a Business Coach. As a coach, one should always be investing in coaches (the general advice I’ve always heard is never hire a coach that doesn’t have a coach of their own!). She has revolutionized how I do business. I am streamlined, and probably ten times as effective as I was this time last year, all because of her.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I have also taken this opportunity to practice being more present with my friends. I have a solid group of long term friends, and I want to make sure to nurture those relationships.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-conclusions-can-i-draw-from-this-review&quot;&gt;What conclusions can I draw from this review?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at how many places I “failed”! I only have one goal that is an unqualified success. But did I really fail? Heck no, of course not! I have grown so much, changed my path and my perspective, and have become a more confident person. My goals were helpful, because setting them gave me a path, but if I had been too rigid, I wouldn’t have been flexible, and open to new opportunities. So I’m delighted with where I am, and I’m excited for the next year to start. As I said last year, it’s remarkable where I am this year as compared to last year. I feel like a completely different person. I’m confident in ways I never would have thought to ask for, and I’m more aware of how to heal some other parts of my life that I haven’t quite gotten to, yet. This year has most certainly not been all kittens and cinnamon. But it has been one of the most productive and revealing years of my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-are-my-goals-for-2019&quot;&gt;What are my goals for 2019?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My financial goals haven’t changed much over this last year. I am going to continue with a variation of what I had last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My list for 2019:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Continue to make my new business my primary source of income&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be in the black with my business&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Keep my expenses low while starting my business&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-about-you&quot;&gt;What about you?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does your 2018 review look like? And what goals have you set for 2019?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Start Your New Year Ready For Bounty</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We’re getting close to the end of the year! Now is a great time to take a beat, and look back on what we did last year, and what we want to do next year. After the new year dawns, I’ll tell you a little bit about my personal retrospective and goals for 2019, but first, take a little time to look backwards and forwards with your money life, so you’re ready to take on 2019!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now is a great time to take out a piece of paper, or open a new document on your computer, and answer a few questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What were your financial goals last year?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Did you meet those goals?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What unexpected paths did your life take?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Looking forward, what goals would you like to set down for 2019?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put the piece of paper in a safe place that you’ll be able to find next year. I even put an appointment item on my calendar for the first week of every year, to remind myself to pull out my old goals and review my year, then make those new goals!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like doing this exercise, because I think it is wonderful to celebrate things we have done throughout the year, but also because I like to celebrate the twists and turns my life has taken. There’s nothing to be ashamed of for not accomplishing our goals, especially if it came about because we took some other wonderful turn in our life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Celebrate the wins, but also relish the complexity and beauty of a life well lived!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why the taboo against talking about money hurts you</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I don’t think I’m saying anything too controversial when I say that our society in America has a taboo against talking about money. We all run into situations where talking about how much we make, how much we spend, or how much debt we are in is just &lt;em&gt;not talked about&lt;/em&gt;. I’m no expert on sociology, but I think these taboos are instilled very early in our lives, and they are sometimes buried very deeply, so deeply that when we pause and ask ourselves “Why?” the answer is often “Because it’s rude” or “Because that is what is always done”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember once when I had gotten my first job out of college. I was at a party with some close friends. I excitedly said how much I was making for my starting salary ($43,000 in 2003! I will always remember that number.) and one of the older women grumpily said, “It must be nice.” I was crushed. I certainly wasn’t trying to make anyone else feel bad. But I had broken the code: you don’t talk about how much you make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;so-what-are-the-problems-with-this-taboo-against-talking-about-money&quot;&gt;So what are the problems with this taboo against talking about money?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;it-reinforces-feelings-of-guilt-and-shame&quot;&gt;It reinforces feelings of guilt and shame&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we can’t talk about money, it becomes something we feel ashamed about. We assume that things we can’t talk about are bad in some way, so we can start assigning guilt to ourselves and our feelings about money. In my situation at the party, it was clear to me that I was supposed to be ashamed for making so much money out of the gate. And I absorbed that lesson well. I felt so bad for being proud of doing well, and getting that salary. This is a terrible lesson to learn. For one thing, talking about your salary with coworkers can help expose imbalances in how people are getting paid, and that is a good thing. Companies need to pay their workers fairly, and they aren’t going to do it if we aren’t talking to each other. And for another, money should not be something to feel guilty about! Money is just a tool - the flow of money from one person to another is an inherently neutral event. It is what we do with that flow that is important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;it-reinforces-lack-of-understanding&quot;&gt;It reinforces lack of understanding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we can’t talk to each other about money, then we can’t learn from others. If someone else makes a mistake and learns a better way, if they can’t talk about it, then I can’t learn from their mistake. And if I can’t learn the vast options that are out there, I might assume that the way I saw my family work with money is the only way, even if they had a dysfunctional relationship with money. The more we talk to each other, the more we can all learn and get better together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;it-reinforces-isolation&quot;&gt;It reinforces isolation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not talking about money doesn’t just isolate us from useful knowledge, it can also isolate us from others in different ways. If we can’t talk to each other about a subject, then how can we display empathy? When someone is in trouble, talking to others can be an important part of healing, but if they can’t do that then they will become isolated. And that is a scary place to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;how-do-we-break-through-this-taboo&quot;&gt;How do we break through this taboo?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be hard to change an entire culture, but I do think that this one thing is changing over time. The best thing you can do is individually try to make a difference by starting to talk about money in your own life. Try talking about your salary with coworkers. Ask your friends for advice when you have a financial decision to make. And offer a kind, open listening ear when someone else is having trouble with money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also recommend making a money accountability buddy. Find someone that has a similar philosophy, and ask them if you could both talk about your money goals, and use each other for accountability. Get together for coffee once a month with them, and talk about what is working and what isn’t working in your money lives. Practicing with just one person you trust can help you both so much!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Stop budgeting, start holding up your Money Mirror</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;What feelings come up when I say the word “Budget”? If you are like most people, the words are often negative: restrictive, guilt, shame, hard, daunting, discouraging. I completely understand those emotions and feelings. I have had most of them myself with regard to this bad word: &lt;strong&gt;budget&lt;/strong&gt;. Why is it we are all told to budget, but then most of us have such negative feelings surrounding the process?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is because budgeting done in the normal way &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; restrictive! It is a process that can guilt us and shame us! We write down our income, we estimate our expenses, then we cross our fingers and hope it all goes well. When something inevitably changes or goes wrong, instead of the budget helping us flex with it, it stares back at us with big red negative numbers and seems to imply that it’s our fault that our life changed, or our priorities changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’d like to suggest a mindset shift. Instead of budgeting, let’s talk about holding up our money mirror. When we hold up our money mirror, we are simply asking the question: “Does our spending align with our values?” It isn’t about guilt, or about “I should…” It is simply “Is this close to my values, or far away from them?” This simple shift can completely revolutionize how we think about money, and about the act budgeting.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Draw Strength From Your Tribe</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Do you have nieces? I do, and they are amazing. Every time I see them, they remind me of the fearless person I was when I was a child, the person I always aspire to be now. My lovely sister has invited me to their soccer games, and every weekend I sit there on the sidelines watching, learning more about them, every single wet morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When they first started this season, they did well, but they weren’t communicating, and it seemed to my untrained eyes like they were eleven girls out on the field, all doing their own thing. They were all good, but… they were’t a team. But this last match I watched was amazing. They were no longer eleven girls. They were one team. One &lt;strong&gt;tribe&lt;/strong&gt;. I watched them as they shouted instructions and advice to each other. They formed into strategic groups, then broke up and formed into different groups, as the situation warranted. They encouraged each other with every movement down the field, and every try for the goal. It’s only been 5 games, a little over a month, and they know each other so well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what have I learned from these hard-working pre-teens? I’ve learned that the power of women in sync, who are committed to teamwork without boundaries is the most powerful force in this world. It has made me appreciate anew the wonderful support group I have in my personal life. And it has made me appreciate the business network I’m building in my professional life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I want to take it one step further. I want to create a community of people that can support each other in their journey to a healthier relationship with money. So I’ve created a new Meetup group called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.meetup.com/Money-Empowerment-Monthly/&quot;&gt;Money Empowerment Monthly&lt;/a&gt; designed to be an open and safe environment for people to get together and help each other change their relationship with money. If you are in Portland or know someone who is, I would like to invite you to the inaugural meeting this October 24th (one week from now!) at 5:30pm at CENTRL Eastside. It is $15 if you sign up early, and $20 at the door!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What is a Normal Month?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;What is a Normal Month? Take a moment to think about what that means to you. Does it mean that you are spending exactly what you expect on your bills? Does it mean that you have no surprise expenses? Does it mean that you are able to pay your groceries in full, and have a little left over?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next question is, when was the last time you had a Normal Month? Many of you probably already know that it is a bit of a trick question. There is no such thing as a “Normal Month”. We live lives that are beautiful, complex, vexing, and wonderful. To have perfectly normal, average months, month after month, it would mean that we are living exactly normal, average, completely predictable lives. And even if that was possible, is that really what you want from your life?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure some unexpected events we could do without. The furnace breaks, or the alternator dies. We end up having less income than usual. Of course we don’t want that! But some things are &lt;strong&gt;wonderful&lt;/strong&gt;. For example, I got the chance to go on a spa day with friends recently. I chose to spend more, so that I could join them. Maybe family comes into town and you want to treat them, take them out to the local sights or to a nice restaurant for dinner. Maybe you get accepted to an artist retreat in France. Whatever it is, you don’t want to constrict your budget so much that you can’t take advantage of the exciting opportunities life tosses you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So don’t put it off: “I’ll start budgeting when I finally have a Normal Month.” Instead commit: “I’ll start budgeting now, so I never have to be caught flat-footed by the wild, crazy wonderful swings in life!”&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Receiving Money Into Your Life</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There once was a girl who got her first job out of high school. She had applied for a job as a sales clerk at the local department store, and she was so proud of herself when she was hired. She had put in the work to have a good resume, and did very well on the interview. She was nervous about her new job, but she knew she could do a good job. But… &lt;!--more--&gt; when she came home, her parents were angry. “Why do you need a job? You’re going to get a husband, and he’s going to take care of you. All you should be concerned about is finding that man.” She was crushed. She called the store and declined the job. Because of this incident, and many others like it, she decided she must not be worthy of receiving money. This feeling has plagued her her entire adult life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all have money stories in our lives and in our past. Sometimes we have stories that encourage excessive spending habits. Sometimes they encourage miserly behavior. And sometimes, like the girl in our story, they tell us that we shouldn’t receive money into our lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think back on your childhood and early adulthood. Do you have any stories that have made you feel like you aren’t worthy of receiving money into your life? What are the elements of the story that made you feel this way. Did someone put down your labors or work you did? Did you develop a feeling that money is evil or tainted? Or did you somehow get the feeling that YOU don’t deserve money?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Money is such a taboo subject, and we all lay so much emotion on top of the concept of money, and receiving money can create such overwhelming emotions in us all. But we can overcome these feelings, and find a new, positive, relationship with money. 
First, it is important to remember, money in and of itself, is not positive OR negative. What we do with money can be of course. But the dollar in your hand is neutral. Also, money is not the goal. Money is a tool for making your life, and the lives of others better and more fulfilling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;things-to-do&quot;&gt;Things to do&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can you do to counteract these old stories and patterns, and build a healthier relationship with receiving money? Here are some ideas. You don’t have to do all of them, and please feel free to modify these in a way that suits you and your life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Become comfortable with talking about money. Talking about taboo subjects lessen their hold on us, and shine a light on what we’re really afraid of. Find someone safe, perhaps that has similar struggles with money, and become “Money Confidantes”. Make a regular coffee date, and take turns sharing your fears and concerns, then share your successes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create a receiving ritual - Every time money comes into your hands, your bank account, or your PayPal account, ring a bell, light a candle, or say a prayer of thanks, or do all three. Or create another ritual that has meaning for you. Another fun way can be to say out loud: “Thank you &lt;person who=&quot;&quot; gave=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot; the=&quot;&quot; money=&quot;&quot;&gt; for honoring me with this money. I honor you and the universe in return. I also honor myself, and I am grateful for the opportunity to receive this money”.&lt;/person&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Spend about five minutes a day visualizing what it will feel like to be wealthy and prosperous. Will you feel content for not having to worry daily about money? Do you feel joy for having the money you need to give back to people and causes you believe in? Do you feel grateful that you are protected in retirement, and will not need to depend on others as you age? When you imagine feeling wealthy, it helps you rewire your brain, and you will be more receptive to the money coming into your life right now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;affirmations&quot;&gt;Affirmations&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you can always work with affirmations. Here are some things to try saying to yourself every day:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Money is not positive or negative. Money is a neutral. What I do with it is what brings value to it.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Having money, or not having money does not change my character. I am me, I am a beautiful sacred person, no matter how much money I have.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Money is not the goal. Money is a tool for making my life, and the lives of others, better and more fulfilling.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“I am worthy of an abundant life. I do good works that are worth the reward of a fair payment”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“I am so happy and grateful now that money comes to me in increasing quantities through multiple sources on a continuous basis.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you choose your affirmations, choose phrases that you can deeply believe. If you are not ready for an affirmation, or it is too “out there”, your subconscious will reject it. So if you need to modify any of these so they are believable to you, do that, and once you are comfortable with them, try expanding them.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Aging Your Money</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It has been so long since I have written on here! I’m glad to say, I’m back, and this will be the final post for the YNAB Series. So let’s get started on the last YNAB Rule!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you read the &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/post/2018/02/07/Make-Your-Budget-Fit-Your-Life.html&quot;&gt;article “Make Your Budget Fit Your Life”&lt;/a&gt;, you’re beginning to see that the best budget is one that flexes with your life. We want a budget that works with us, rather then making us feel bad for not fitting into a rigid box. So what is the last rule? And what does it mean?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can read the rest of the series here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/post/2018/01/17/YNAB.html&quot;&gt;What is YNAB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/post/2018/01/24/Give-Every-Dollar-A-Job.html&quot;&gt;What is the Purpose of Your Money?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/post/2018/01/31/What-Are-True-Expenses.html&quot;&gt;What Are True Expenses?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/post/2018/02/07/Make-Your-Budget-Fit-Your-Life.html&quot;&gt;Make Your Budget Fit Your Life (not the other way around)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/post/2018/04/26/Aging-Your-Money.html&quot;&gt;Aging Your Money&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, we’ve covered the three most fundamental rules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Give Every Dollar A Job&lt;/strong&gt;, which reminds us that we need to work with the reality of the dollars we have right now.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Embrace Your True Expenses&lt;/strong&gt;, which tells us that we need to account for every type of expense we have, not just your bills, and including your savings goals.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roll With The Punches&lt;/strong&gt;, which gives you permission to change your budget when you need to, and gives you a safe way to do so.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;age-your-money&quot;&gt;Age Your Money&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last rule is “Age Your Money.” You can find the age of your money in the upper-right hand corner of the screen in YNAB:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/AgeOfMoney.png&quot; alt=&quot;Age Of Money Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aging Your Money means that we want to hold onto money for longer and longer periods of time. If you are living paycheck to paycheck, when you spend a dollar the day you got paid, that dollar is considered one day old. But if you hold onto that dollar until the next day, it will be two days old, and so on. So when we talk about aging your money, we are saying that we are living on dollars that we earned some time ago. And old money is good, because it means that we have savings, and are breaking out of the paycheck-to-paycheck cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fourth rule, incidentally, used to be “Live on Last Month’s Income”. With that rule, the goal was to age your money to at least 30 days old. So when you spent your money, it would have been money you earned last month. That was a pretty binary and rigid rule though, and it make it hard to see your progress, so now you can take it day by day, and increase the age of your money gradually, celebrating your progress as your money gets older. I still recommend setting 30 days as a good goal, though, because if you have 30 days, you’ve officially broken the paycheck-to-paycheck cycle, which is really an amazing accomplishment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that Aging Your Money is a fantastic goal. But I also think it is OK not to concentrate on it. You may put a high priority on paying down debt, or contributing to savings goals. By all means, feel free to ignore the number in the upper-right hand corner of your screen. If you are working the first three rules, the fourth rule will start to come to you naturally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;final-thoughts&quot;&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there you have it! The four YNAB rules, all there in black and white! All that is left is to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ynab.com&quot;&gt;Sign up for the one month YNAB Trial&lt;/a&gt;, or contact me at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:cecilia@bountifulmoneyllc.com&quot; target=&quot;&quot;&gt;cecilia@bountifulmoneyllc.com&lt;/a&gt; for more information and to set up an initial strategy session.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Make Your Budget Fit Your Life</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If you’ve read the &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/post/2018/01/31/What-Are-True-Expenses.html&quot;&gt;article last week&lt;/a&gt;, you know how to why it is important to embrace your true expenses, and what they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we know about Giving Every Dollar a Job, and Embracing our True Expenses, the next rule is Roll With the Punches, which is my favorite rule, because it is what transforms YNAB from an expense tracker to a guilt and shame free budget planner, and allows your budget to fit your life, instead of trying to fit your life to your budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can read the rest of the series here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/post/2018/01/17/YNAB.html&quot;&gt;What is YNAB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/post/2018/01/24/Give-Every-Dollar-A-Job.html&quot;&gt;What is the Purpose of Your Money?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/post/2018/01/31/What-Are-True-Expenses.html&quot;&gt;What Are True Expenses?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/post/2018/02/07/Make-Your-Budget-Fit-Your-Life.html&quot;&gt;Make Your Budget Fit Your Life (not the other way around)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/post/2018/04/26/Aging-Your-Money.html&quot;&gt;Aging Your Money&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does it do that? Well, with the first two rules, we are creating our budget plan. We know we need to plan for every dollar (Rule 1) and we need to plan for every expenses (Rule 2). But what do we do when life doesn’t go according to plan? Do we throw out the plan? Or do we adjust the plan to work with our new situation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course we work with our new situation. Most budgeting techniques tend to fall down on this part. You might make the most perfect plan at the start of the month, but if it isn’t easy to adjust the plan as you go along, you’ll find yourself gradually abandoning the plan. And you might even feel bad, like somehow you’re “bad at budgeting”. But that’s not true. Your budget is failing you, not the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So YNAB has “Roll With the Punches”. Lets say your brother calls and says he’s unexpectedly going to be in town this weekend, could he come see you? Of course you want to have some fun with him, you don’t get to see him very often. So you plan to cook a nice dinner, and maybe you decide to surprise him with tickets to the local symphony. Maybe you have the money for the entertainment in your budget, but this special dinner is going to cost you $50 (you both sure like steak!), money that will take you over on your grocery budget. What should you do? You can just let the category go over $50, but that means that you can’t be sure you’ll have money available for your other categories (see the post on &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/post/2017/11/22/Envelope-Budgeting.html&quot;&gt;envelope budgeting&lt;/a&gt; for more information). So we need to find that money from somewhere else in our budget. Maybe we reduce our savings on one of our savings categories, maybe Vacations or something like that. Or we might reduce the amount in one of our variable categories, like Entertainment, or Personal Care, or something like that. Wherever we might have money that you aren’t prioritizing as highly as this time with your brother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that is the key to Rolling With the Punches – What are your priorities &lt;em&gt;right now&lt;/em&gt;? Do you want the manicure or the steak dinner more? Do you need to pay your electricity or save for emergencies? We make these choices all the time, but YNAB gives you a very clear way to see those choices, while making sure we don’t get into debt trying to do &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;. There are no right or wrong answers to “what is my highest priority”? There’s only the answer that aligns most closely with your values and goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;final-thoughts&quot;&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to leave you with one last thought about Rule 3. Sometimes when you’re just starting out, you might think the goal is to stop needing to Roll With the Punches. You &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; want to stop having to move things around due to poor decision-making, or emotional spending. But I’m here to tell you that I’ve been working with YNAB for four years, and I have used Rule 3 every single month I’ve used it. You want that flexibility to change our budget, because if it is inflexible, it won’t change with your changing circumstances, which means you may abandon your budget. Budgeting isn’t here to strangle you, or tell you what you “should” do. It’s here to help you prioritize your spending. And Rule 3 helps you do it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What are True Expenses?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If you’ve read the &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/post/2018/01/24/Give-Every-Dollar-A-Job.html&quot;&gt;article last week&lt;/a&gt;, you know that you need to give your dollars jobs, but how do you decide what jobs are necessary in your life?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You use the second YNAB rule to figure that out. “Embrace Your True Expenses” tells us that we need to fully understand our expenses, and not just the regular bills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can read the rest of the series here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/post/2018/01/17/YNAB.html&quot;&gt;What is YNAB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/post/2018/01/24/Give-Every-Dollar-A-Job.html&quot;&gt;What is the Purpose of Your Money?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/post/2018/01/31/What-Are-True-Expenses.html&quot;&gt;What Are True Expenses?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/post/2018/02/07/Make-Your-Budget-Fit-Your-Life.html&quot;&gt;Make Your Budget Fit Your Life (not the other way around)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/post/2018/04/26/Aging-Your-Money.html&quot;&gt;Aging Your Money&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-are-true-expenses&quot;&gt;What are “true” expenses&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think most folks have a pretty good idea of what their regular monthly expenses are. Keeping track of things like rent and utilities is usually pretty easy. But to budget fully, we really need to make sure we have a plan for everything we are going to spend money on. So what other kinds of expenses do we have that we need to give categories?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to think of expenses as four different kinds of expenses:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Regular and Frequent&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Regular and Infrequent&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Irregular and Frequent&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Irregular and Infrequent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A “Regular” expense is one where you always know how much you are going to spend. “Irregular” means the amount can vary. “Frequent” means monthly, and “Infrequent” is less often then that. What are some examples of these expenses?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Regular and Frequent - Your bills like rent, cell phone, and cable&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Regular and Infrequent - Bills that happen every six months or a year, like car insurance premiums, or annual subscriptions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Irregular and Frequent - Your bills like electricity (the amount varies from month to month) or expenses like groceries&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Irregular and Infrequent - Emergencies. If you own a car, I can guarantee you are going to have a car emergency, but I can’t predict when it will happen, or how much it will cost, so it belongs in this category.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you have accounted for your expenses in all four of these categories, you can say that you have “embraced your true expenses.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;why-do-we-follow-this-rule&quot;&gt;Why do we follow this rule?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is helpful to follow this rule, because it allows us to smooth out our budget. If we know we have a car insurance premium payment coming up in five months for $300, we can start saving in that category now, so when the expense comes up we already have the money budgeted. Saving $60 per month is way easier then trying to come up with the full $300 in the moment, don’t you think?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It helps with our variable categories too, like groceries. We can start getting an idea of how much we really spend on groceries over time, and therefore we’ll get better at making guesses at how much we need to budget for it. That also helps us smooth out our budget over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And lastly, we can start saving for our emergencies. We know they are going to happen, so how much do we need to save into that category to feel secure? Making that decision depends entirely on how secure you want to feel in your situation. For your car emergency category, think about what makes sense. Do you have a brand new Toyota with a three year full warranty on it? Maybe you don’t need much in the category. Or do you have a twenty-year old jolopy? Maybe you would feel more comfortable with a large fund for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, one reason to have a budget is to reduce the surprises, and to smooth out your budget. Embracing Your True Expenses is the rule that helps us make that happen!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What is the Purpose of Your Money?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;What do you want your money to do for you? Do you want to travel the world with it, or buy a house for your family? What about taking art classes, or donating to causes you believe in? Is there something stopping you from achieving those goals? I know that for years, I never felt like I could save for those things, because I didn’t know if I had enough money. I didn’t know where my money was going, so I was afraid to use it for anything more then bills. If you are worried about covering your bills, then how can you set money aside for the bigger goals?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the second article in the YNAB Series, and I’m going to talk about YNAB’s first rule – Give Every Dollar a Job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can read the rest of the series here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/post/2018/01/17/YNAB.html&quot;&gt;What is YNAB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/post/2018/01/24/Give-Every-Dollar-A-Job.html&quot;&gt;What is the Purpose of Your Money?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/post/2018/01/31/What-Are-True-Expenses.html&quot;&gt;What Are True Expenses?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/post/2018/02/07/Make-Your-Budget-Fit-Your-Life.html&quot;&gt;Make Your Budget Fit Your Life (not the other way around)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/post/2018/04/26/Aging-Your-Money.html&quot;&gt;Aging Your Money&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the main ways that budgeting helps us manage our money is by illuminating our money situation and our money habits. If we don’t know where we stand right now, and we don’t know our goals, we’ll never be able to plan how to get from the starting point to the end point. So the start of our budgeting practice is “Give Every Dollar a Job”. But what does that really mean?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, “Give Every Dollar a Job” implies that we are giving the money we have &lt;strong&gt;right now&lt;/strong&gt; jobs. By only working with money we currently have in our possession, we avoid “projecting” our budget. In many traditional budgeting systems, you start with the month by asking “OK, what money do I think I will get this month?” Even if you have a steady salary, that is a risky thing to do, because it roots your budget in a somewhat imaginary number. I think most of us know that in the back of our minds, and it undermines our confidence in our budget. Even more, when we budget money we don’t yet have, we can’t guarantee that when we spend from a category, that that money actually exists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, giving every dollar a job means we are very intentional with our spending planning. We think through what we need to spend until the next time we get paid. When we put money into those categories, we can rest easy, knowing that the money will be ready when we need it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, by giving every dollar a job we can trust our category balances. In other words, if I have all of my bill categories funded, if I go to the clothing store and look at my clothing category, and it says I have $100, that means I can spend up to $100 without having to worry if I’m somehow cutting into my rent money, or utilities, or anything else. All those categories are funded with real money, too, so spending money on clothing will have nothing to do with what you can spend later in those other categories. Again, the same as if I’m projecting my income, if I budget more dollars then I have, I can no longer trust my category balances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;why-is-this-rule-so-important&quot;&gt;Why is this rule so important?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giving Every Dollar A Job is the most fundamental method of &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/post/2017/11/22/Envelope-Budgeting.html&quot;&gt;envelope budgeting&lt;/a&gt; – When you get money, you take all of that money and put it in envelopes. When you need that money, you take that envelope with you, and spend it. This is the same thing, but instead we’re using software, because it’s more flexible and fits into modern life.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>YNAB - My budgeting software of choice</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Budgeting is the foundation of building a wonderful and stable financial life. But I don’t like the way budgeting is usually taught, when it is taught at all. Forecasting and rigidity are common problems that you may have encountered in trying to budget. &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/post/2017/11/22/Envelope-Budgeting.html&quot;&gt;Envelope Budgeting&lt;/a&gt; is something I have recommended before, and I mentioned &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ynab.com&quot;&gt;YNAB (You Need A Budget)&lt;/a&gt; as my software of choice to implement envelope budgeting. Let’s dig into YNAB, see what it can give us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can read the rest of the series here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/post/2018/01/17/YNAB.html&quot;&gt;What is YNAB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/post/2018/01/24/Give-Every-Dollar-A-Job.html&quot;&gt;What is the Purpose of Your Money?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/post/2018/01/31/What-Are-True-Expenses.html&quot;&gt;What Are True Expenses?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/post/2018/02/07/Make-Your-Budget-Fit-Your-Life.html&quot;&gt;Make Your Budget Fit Your Life (not the other way around)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/post/2018/04/26/Aging-Your-Money.html&quot;&gt;Aging Your Money&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;why-ynab&quot;&gt;Why YNAB?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have used YNAB personally for over three years, and in that time, I’ve completely turned around my life. We paid off my and my husband’s student loans, car loans, paid off our credit cards, and have stopped using them as a crutch. I credit that in large part to how YNAB works. In a nutshell, YNAB is a philosophy that is supported by software. There are four “rules”, more like guidelines, that the software helps you follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-four-ynab-rules&quot;&gt;The four YNAB rules&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four rules are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Give Every Dollar a Job&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Embrace Your True Expenses&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Roll With The Punches&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Live on Last Month’s Income&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you work with these rules, you will find your financial life starts making sense, and you can start spending according to your values and goals, because you will have clarity on your &lt;strong&gt;whole&lt;/strong&gt; situation. I will go through all four of these rules in brief here, but I plan on writing articles on each of the rules in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;give-every-dollar-a-job&quot;&gt;Give Every Dollar a Job&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fundamental rule is why YNAB is an envelope budgeting system. Every time you receive money, you give it a job, which in YNAB you do by putting the money in categories you have set up. These categories are like the envelopes you would use if you were working in a cash system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to give every dollar a job, because then everything has a purpose. When you allocate $300 for groceries, you know what the purpose is for that $300. Also it keeps you from allocating more then one job for your dollars. If, for example, you have your $1200 rent payment in the rent category, you know you can pay it without worrying about it affecting your grocery category. It is extremely powerful to be able to spend from a category without having to worry that your other plans will get affected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;embrace-your-true-expenses&quot;&gt;Embrace Your True Expenses&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever had a bill come up that comes up every six months, and been surprised by it? Maybe you even had to tighten your belt on other expenses to be able to pay for it? Or had an unexpected car breakdown that completely wrecked your finances for months? With YNAB, you can make room for all your expenses, whether they be frequent and a regular amount, or infrequent and a surprising amount. You can break down those expenses to smaller monthly chunks that will have a much smaller affect on your budget, and you’ll be ready for any kind of expense you may have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;roll-with-the-punches&quot;&gt;Roll with the Punches&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tell my clients, this is my favorite rule! This is truly what sets YNAB apart from other programs for me. This rule means that when your life or your priorities change, your budget changes with it, instead of &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/post/2017/12/27/Guilt-And-Shame.html&quot;&gt;shaming&lt;/a&gt; you for not “sticking to your budget”. When you have something unexpected happen, and you need to spend more in a category, that’s just fine! Just find the money in other categories and move it to the category that needed it. No guilt, no shame, just your budget moving with you&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;live-on-last-months-income&quot;&gt;Live on Last Month’s Income&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living on Last Month’s Income means that when you start a new month, you have all the money you need to fully budget that month. It means that you are always working one month ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why would we do this? It does a couple things. One is it simplifies monthly budgeting. Instead of budgeting every time you get paid, you can budget all at once, on the first of the month. Second, it means you don’t have to “time” your bills. Because all bills are given a job on the first of the month, you can conceivably pay any bill at any time in the month. In fact, you could pay them all on the first, if you wanted to. These two main things lead to one amazing thing - it reduces financial stress. Can you imagine not worrying about your bills and when they are paid? It is an amazing feeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another benefit of Living on Last Month’s Income is that you have an automatic one-month emergency fund. If, for example, you lose your job, you have a full month breathing space to strategize, and work to get a new job. And when you look for a job with less stress, you will do a better job interviewing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-next&quot;&gt;What next?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I encourage you to sign up with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ynab.com&quot;&gt;YNAB&lt;/a&gt;. You can try it for 34 days free, and thereafter it is $6.99/mo, billed annually. I also provide local and remote &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/services.html&quot;&gt;Money Coaching&lt;/a&gt;, to help you align your money habits with your values and goals. And stay tuned for my articles expanding on YNAB’s Four Rules!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My yearly review</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned last week, I’m not big on New Year Resolutions. But I do think it is important to make goals, and track our progress. The past few years, I’ve done an informal, high level yearly review of my financial situation, and it’s really helped me gain a perspective of how my goals change over time. I’d like to share with you my 2017 review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote this list down at the beginning of last year, in a calendar item set for the beginning of this January. Notice how high level it is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Kill the boat loan&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Move onto boat&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Move to remote job&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fully Fund Roth IRA’s&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Maximize 401(k)s&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have a retirement portfolio worth of more than $xyz [Author note: I have removed the amounts for this goal, but I’ll talk about whether or not I have achieved it, and how it worked for me]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how does this list compare to where I stand right now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;kill-the-boat-loan-and-move-onto-the-boat&quot;&gt;Kill the boat loan, and move onto the boat&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DONE! I’m going to combine these two goals into one, because they are related in how I achieved them. I did this one by selling my house, moving onto the boat, and using some of the proceeds to pay off the remainder of the loan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;move-to-remote-job&quot;&gt;Move to remote job&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SORT OF. I quit my job, and am working at building my own business (Money Coaching, FTW!). Much of this work can be done at home. It has the added advantage of being very flexible, and it’s empowering to work for myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fully-fund-roth-iras&quot;&gt;Fully Fund Roth IRA’s&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DONE! Even though I don’t have a job anymore, I had a job for half the year, which means I can fund my Roth. I may need to figure out a different retirement vehicle for next year, if I continue to not have a traditional job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;maximize-my-401k&quot;&gt;Maximize my 401(k)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SORT OF. I maxed it for some of the year, but when I realized the coming changes in my life, I reduced it to the percentage that my company made contributions for. When I quit my job, even that went away. But I’m going to count this one as a success, because I did the right things at the right time. Remember, don’t be a slave to your goals, just for the sake of checking them off! Do what is important is to do what is right for your life, at that moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;have-a-retirement-portfolio-worth-of-more-than-xyz&quot;&gt;Have a retirement portfolio worth of more than $xyz&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DONE! I set this goal when I was looking at my retirement situation from a combined perspective. When my husband and I separated (see below), I think this goal needed to be separated, too. That makes my goal half of the original. I hit well over that amount!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-else-happened-this-year&quot;&gt;What else happened this year?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I separated from my husband of 15 years, and we’re on track to get divorced early this year. We’ve both made it personal goals to stay good friends, and so far, I feel we’ve done very well at that. While this isn’t a financial goal, it has wide-ranging ramifications on all of my financial goals, so I included it anyway.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I quit my job. This one is &lt;strong&gt;huge&lt;/strong&gt; for me. I loved my job and I had been at the company over five years. I loved the people I worked with, and enjoyed the kind of work I did. But over the last year and a half or so, the company had been making increasingly poor decisions. Several people I enjoyed working with either moved on, or were laid off. And worst of all, the environment turned toxic. I ended up having a terrible panic attack, directly related to the job. I’ve never seen such a fast change in attitudes. I was quite frankly appalled at the way people were treated, and finally couldn’t stomach staying there another day, especially as it was affecting my mental health. I took the leap, and I haven’t looked back.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I turned in a leased car, thus eliminating that lease, and I bought a car with cash. It’s a simple older Toyota Yaris, but its mine, and I never owed anyone for it!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I am now &lt;strong&gt;completely&lt;/strong&gt; debt free! I am my own woman, and not beholden to anyone else. Except my cat. I’m always beholden to her.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-conclusions-can-i-draw-from-this-review&quot;&gt;What conclusions can I draw from this review?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it’s always interesting to me to see how far off my life is from what I imagined, even over the course of only one year. I got a divorce, which sent me scrambling for security in my personal life, even while I used it as an opportunity to take a huge chance in my professional life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-are-my-goals-for-2018&quot;&gt;What are my goals for 2018?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I think I’ve learned a lot over this past year. My retirement goals are still very important to me, but I’ve been easing off on them a bit in order to concentrate on shifting my career. It’s become more important to me to contribute to the world around me in some beneficial way, and I think that coaching people to improve their financial health is a very good contribution to the world. I haven’t put my other goals completely aside, but I have to concentrate on other things right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here is my list for 2018:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be making enough money with my own business to sustain myself at my &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/post/2017/12/13/Bare-Bones-Number.html&quot;&gt;Bare Bones Number&lt;/a&gt;. Right now that is about $2800/mo&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;And if I haven’t achieved that, have a part-time in a related field to continue growing and expanding professionally.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stay debt-free!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Contribute to my retirement funds&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have a retirement portfolio worth $xyz.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-about-you&quot;&gt;What about you?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does your 2017 review look like? And what goals have you set for 2018?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Guilt and Shame</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Do you feel guilty about your money past? Perhaps you’ve made a bad investment, or haven’t invested at all. Maybe someone you trusted someone stole money from you, or you have a spending addiction. Whatever it is, we all have times that we have made bad decisions involving money, and that can lead to all sorts of negative emotions – guilt, anger, betrayal, shame, and more. What’s worse, over time it can leave you feeling in doubt of your own ability to manage money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;my-family-history-with-money&quot;&gt;My family history with money&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are not alone! Most people have a bad story involving money. My personal story is actually rather average. My father made pretty good money all throughout my childhood, but neither of my parents were really good at managing money, so all through my childhood, even though we were middle class, it always felt to me like we were one disaster away from total financial devastation. It think that is particularly common in today’s environment of terrible healthcare coverage, among other things. That fostered a lasting feeling of insecurity that I have spent most of my adult life trying to create a perfectly secure environment around me. In the small things, I’m spontaneous (friends might call me “random”), but in the large things I am &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; conservative. I started saving for retirement early by saving into my very first 401(k) and starting a Roth IRA as soon as I had my first job. Investing may seem very risky to many people, but I saw it as a way to make sure that I never ended up depending on a by-no-means guaranteed social security check in my old age. I knew that if I invested early in relatively risky stocks, I would have time to recover from market downturns, and reap the rewards of time spent invested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That all may seem fine, but I did it to the exclusion of other parts of my life. I was so scared of losing that ability to save, that I stayed in jobs long after they had ceased to be a challenge, or made me happy. I stayed in personal relationships because they were a good bet financially (well, it’s never that simple, but it was certainly a factor). So my life got pretty far out of balance for a lot of years. I’ve made changes to try to counteract it, but like many things, it’s a work in progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I do feel guilty. I also feel sad, like I lost so many years being scared. And a bit angry at myself for not being more true to myself. I acknowledge those feelings, but I also am working to change my world as it is right now. That is most important. I think I will always struggle with finding the balance of too stodgy and too reckless. But the most important thing is that I’m aware, and I’m always trying to find the balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;other-reasons-we-may-feel-guilt-and-shame&quot;&gt;Other reasons we may feel guilt and shame&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may, like me, feel guilty because of behaviors you learned from your family history. But there are other reasons, too. Some of them are cultural. Perhaps you are a woman, and have been told in countless small and large ways that you can’t possibly be good with money. Or maybe the cultural stigma of not talking about money has made it hard for you to seek help when you were confused about your money situation. There are many ways our own culture and society can undermine our relationships with money, and what’s worse, they can be hard to identify, because we’re so steeped in our own cultural biases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or perhaps you have had one or many bad experiences with money personally. Perhaps a bad investment, or getting out of the market at the wrong time made you lose a lot of money, and your confidence was lost at the same time. Or you’ve always been a shop-a-holic, and you know how much that has damaged your financial security. Whatever it is, you can absolutely have negative feelings that undermine your ability to get back to a healthy, trusting relationship with money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-should-we-do-about-our-guilt-and-shame&quot;&gt;What should we do about our guilt and shame?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first want to make sure that you honor your feelings. So often, we push away our negative feelings, because they are unpleasant. But to truly savor the joys in life, it is necessary to be fully present when we are experiencing the negative. So before you do anything else, spend a few moments just sitting with your feelings. What are those feelings? When you contemplate them, do other feelings wash over you, too? Or maybe memories come back to you? Sometimes it is helpful to journal this experience. You may find that journaling (like the &lt;a href=&quot;/post/2017/11/15/The-Five-Whys.html&quot;&gt;Five Whys&lt;/a&gt; exercise) helps you dig deeper into your past experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to feel your feelings, but you can then harness them to make positive changes in your life. I like to reframe my negative emotions about money – they are trying to send up a red flag that your finances are not in balance with your values. If you see the red flags, you can change your behaviors. Once you have acknowledged and honored your feelings, you can get down to the business of figuring out how to modify your behaviors. Remember, even small changes can make a huge difference in your life overall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;final-thoughts&quot;&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your negative feelings about money can be a natural consequence of your cultural, familial, and personal experiences with money. You are not alone in feeling guilt and shame about our money situation, most of us have had negative experiences in the past with money. The great thing is, they are important red flags that can help you recognize what you want to change in your life. And once you start making changes in your life that align your finances with your values, you will find yourself healing your relationship with money.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What To Do When Your Expenses are more than your Income!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So you’ve &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/post/2017/12/13/Bare-Bones-Number.html&quot;&gt;Calculated your Bare Bones Number&lt;/a&gt; and you know that your expenses are larger than your income. What do you do now? The first thing is, pause and honor yourself taking an open-eyed look at your situation. You can’t fix an issue if you don’t even know it exists, so congratulate yourself for understanding where you stand right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, how much is the difference between your income and your squeak-by expenses? Is it a few dollars, is it hundreds, or even thousands of dollars more per month? Knowing how drastic the difference is will tell you how drastic your action will need to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How have you been dealing with this discrepancy in your life up until now? Are you racking up debt, draining your savings, living off of others? Whatever it is, it’s important to understand how it has been affecting your life so far, and how you cope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you are asking yourself these questions, remember to pay attention to your emotions. Dealing with a situation like this can be distressing, and you want to make sure that you don’t become so distraught that you abandon this exploration, and go bury your head in the sand. Any time you start feeling angry, guilty or ashamed, do something calming. Make yourself a cup of tea, stand up and stretch, call a supportive friend, whatever you need to do to get your stress levels down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have an idea of how big the difference between your income and expenses is, you can start strategizing on how you will solve it. Here is the basic rule – If your expenses are bigger than your income, you will be doing one of the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Decrease your expenses&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Increase your income&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Draw from your savings&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get into more debt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those choices are the only choices you have, when you have more expenses than income. Notice the order I put them in - They are roughly in order of most ideal to least ideal. You should try to do one or both of the first two &lt;strong&gt;before&lt;/strong&gt; you resort to one of the last two. It may seem obvious, but how often have you reached for your credit card, before even thinking about the other options you may have? That said, sometimes your situation is dire enough that you will need to use your savings or create more debt. Perhaps you are recently unemployed. When that is the case, you will be working on increasing your income by trying to get a new job, but in the meantime, you will have to draw from your savings if you have it, or go into debt if you don’t. Drawing from savings is obviously better in that situation, but if you don’t have savings, then debt is going to be your last resort. I’ll talk in later articles about how to save money for emergencies like unemployment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even when you are using your savings or increasing debt, you will want to concentrate on one or both of the first two, so you can stop using your savings as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets examine the pros and cons of both:
Decreasing expenses can be much faster than increasing your income. Increasing income usually means getting a higher paying job, getting a raise, starting a second job, or starting a side-hustle. That can take a while to get, plus then even after you get it, you may need to wait for two weeks or a month to get your first paycheck or invoice paid. Even selling things you own can take time, you need to list it, then someone needs to see it, etcetera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decreasing expenses often entails cancelling a service online, or a simple phone call to a service company, which can be relatively quick. There are many articles out there for techniques on doing things like lowering your phone bill, so I won’t go over them here, but I highly suggest googling them. People have been very resourceful over time, and it can be inspiring to see what others do to decrease expenses without decreasing their lifestyle much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increasing income may be slower, but it can have a much bigger impact on that delta between expenses and income. After all, you may save $80/month on cable, but a raise or better job may be ten times that much, depending on many factors. It takes a while, but can have a real impact on your financial life. Also, you may already be operating with your expenses very close to the bone. In that case, you may not have much on the expenses side that you can cut. But just a gentle reminder, often you can cut more than you think. We as humans get used to a certain level of expenses in our lives, and they can start to seem necessary, even when they really aren’t. Try to take a level look at your expenses, are they &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; necessary? And are they necessary, &lt;em&gt;right now&lt;/em&gt;? Could you cut them out for a while, as you get yourself back on your feet? Not all expenses have to be cut forever. But you may find that some of those expenses you never let back into your life, because it turns out you do just fine without them! I’ve personally never regretted cancelling cable, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;quick-review&quot;&gt;Quick Review&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt; &lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Decrease Expenses&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Increase Income&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Pros&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Can be much faster&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Can have a larger effect on your budget&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Cons&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;May not be able to reduce very much&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Can take a really long time&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you don’t have a discrepancy between your income and your Squeak-By Expenses, you may have one between your income and your average spending. You may want to go through this process in that situation too, because the same risks exist, like getting yourself into more debt, creating instability in your life, and so on. The only difference is, while you are figuring it out, you should be able to reduce your expenses to the Bare Bones level while you work through how you want to solve it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What Is Your Bare Bones Number?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Do you know what financial level you are living at? Are you living close to the bone, or are you living freely, with all of your needs &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; your wants being met? And how do you know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When clients come to me to get their finances under control, one of the first things I do is help them to understand their “Bare Bones Number.” My mentor &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lunajaffe.com&quot;&gt;Luna Jaffe&lt;/a&gt; likes to call it the “Squeak-By Number,” because it’s the number that you would be just squeaking by on. It is the minimum amount of money you could spend every month, to just barely get by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is helpful to know your Bare Bones Number, because then you are aware of how much you could cut from your life in an emergency, if absolutely everything went wrong, what would you be left paying? And it is very useful to have this as a calculated number, because it gives a sense of peace and control to know what you could cut down to, and still live. It also shows you whether you are already living Bare-Bones or not. A lot of folks think they are living at the absolute edge of their expenses, but we often find that there are still places that you can cut expenses, sometimes with little to no effect on your  quality of life. We get so used to the amenities and experiences in our lives, sometimes it ends up feeling like those are necessities, when in reality, they don’t really belong below the Bare-Bones line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-exercise&quot;&gt;The exercise&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take out a piece of paper (or a spreadsheet, if that’s what you like), then go through all of your bank statements for ALL of your personal accounts including your credit cards, for the last two months. For every charge decide, ask yourself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Was this necessary for my most basic living?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some things are easy. Your utility bills are one that is obviously Bare-Bones. Also minimum debt payments are another. You &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; keep up with your debt payments, because the consequences of not doing so can be dire. Things like rent, though, are deceptive. It seems Bare Bones, but is it really? Are you living in the smallest house or apartment you could be? Would it be possible for you to move somewhere cheaper, and still be happy and comfortable? We Americans live in &lt;strong&gt;huge&lt;/strong&gt; houses, maybe a smaller apartment wouldn’t be as much fun, but it may serve your Bare Bones Number little better. The same goes with groceries. Bare Bones doesn’t mean organic. It means the cheapest you can get away with and still be relatively healthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you go through your statements, write down the items that you decide are Bare Bones on your paper, and write down how much you spent in one month for that item. When you are done, you should have a list of items that you can total up. That total is your Bare Bones Number. Now ask yourself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;How does this number make me feel?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does it seem too high? Is it too low? How close is your current living situation to your Bare Bones number? This exercise can bring up all sorts of emotions. Perhaps you are distressed at how high the number is, or how close it is to your current living situation. Or maybe you have realized that you can live on even less than you ever thought you could. What a feeling of freedom, knowing you can cut way back, and still survive!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one will have the same Bare Bones number. We all live different lives. Perhaps you have medical issues that others don’t, or you have kids. Or you live in an expensive city. All these things can effect that number, so it’s not helpful to compare your number with other people’s. But what can be helpful is revisiting this number over time, every six months or so. Our own lives change all the time, so your number will probably change, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;how-can-you-use-this-number&quot;&gt;How can you use this number?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not advocating you make it a goal to live at your Bare Bones Number. It is actually the opposite. Once you know what your Bare Bones Number is, and if your income is significantly over that, then of course you can add in the things that make our lives full and rewarding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are living well, and have a good job, just knowing your number can help you understand how much you need to save for an emergency fund. Many people advise having at least 6 months of expenses saved. Now you can take your Bare Bones Number, multiply by six, and know how much is a fairly good Emergency Fund goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are already living close to your Bare Bones Number, this exercises often brings up areas where you can cut even further. If you cut just a bit more, you might be able to buy yourself some breathing room, while you use other methods to also improve your financial situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you may find in calculating your Bare Bones Number that your expenses are larger than your income. My next article will be about what to do if you find yourself in that situation.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Credit Card Float</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There’s a hidden debt trap that you could be falling into. I know I sound like one of those terrible commercials trying to persuade you to give them money to get your debt cancelled. But there &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; a way to get into debt without knowing you are in debt, and it is called “Credit Card Float.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Credit Card Float is where you charge your everyday expenses to your credit card over the period of the month, then when you get paid, you pay off the credit card in full, thus never incurring any interest payments. The trouble is, you don’t have enough money to pay for your upcoming expenses, so you have to turn right around and start using the credit card again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the simple way to tell if you are Floating. Ask yourself “If I paid off my credit card today, would I have enough money to cover my expenses until the next time I get paid?” If you answer no, then you are Floating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are in debt because you are paying for expenses first, then getting your income to cover those expenses later. It means that if for some reason you became unemployed, or stopped making money, you would already be one month of expenses in debt, with no way to pay it off. What a scary place to be! Just when you need full reserves, you’ll find yourself in debt before you can even think about how to get out of your current income crunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ynab.com&quot;&gt;YNAB&lt;/a&gt;, my favorite budgeting program, one of the four rules used to be “Live on Last Month’s Income”. I will write about that rule sometime in the future, but basically the idea is you are always running one month ahead of your expenses. When you are Floating, you are doing the opposite, you are paying for today’s expenses with &lt;strong&gt;next&lt;/strong&gt; month’s income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;how-do-you-get-out-of-credit-card-float&quot;&gt;How do you get out of Credit Card Float?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many ways to get out of the Credit Card Float. But here are a few ideas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;stop&quot;&gt;Stop!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above all, stop using your credit card, and start using your debit card. This separates your ongoing spending from your Float (debt), which makes it easier to use any one of the following methods to pay off the Float. Note that when you switch to the debit card, you will not be able to pay off your credit card in full next month, because you were using that money to pay this month’s expenses, which will mean you will start incurring interest charges. Usually Float isn’t a huge amount, as it is equal to one month’s expenses, so if you prioritize paying of your Float, you’ll be able to get rid of it quickly, and probably have spent very little on interest in the meantime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember to keep paying at least the minimum payment, though! You don’t want to harm your credit while you’re paying down this debt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;use-your-savings&quot;&gt;Use your savings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are lucky enough to have some savings, you can pull some of those savings out, and pay off your credit card bill with that, instead of next month’s paycheck. This is probably the quickest and cheapest way to get current with your credit card. It can hurt emotionally to use your savings to pay the Float, but remember, your savings is already a bit illusory, because you are also in debt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;throw-your-extra-cash-into-it&quot;&gt;Throw your extra cash into it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you have a windfall, sell something, or get a gift, throw that money at your credit card. Every little bit helps, and eventually, you will pay off your Float.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;use-your-extra-paycheck&quot;&gt;Use your extra paycheck.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you get paid every two weeks? If so, every year you have two months where you get paid three times a month, instead of two. If one of those months is coming up, consider using the “extra” paycheck to throw at your Float. It can bring your balance down by at least half, which is a huge morale boost, then you can work on the rest of the balance using other methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are just a few ideas for paying it down. Like all debt payment strategies, the most important thing is to get creative! Make it a game – how quickly can you pay down your Float?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-next&quot;&gt;What next?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve paid off your Float, you can consider starting to use your credit card again. Because you already have a proven track record of paying your credit card off every month, you’ll probably continue to do well with it. But now when you use it, every dollar you spend on your credit card, you know you have a dollar in your bank account that backs that debt. It’s an amazing feeling to know that you can pay your credit card at any time, and still have enough money in your account to pay for all your expenses!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Balance Giving with Budgeting</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When we explore our money life, we dig deep into our bills, essentials like groceries, debt payments, and discretionary spending. But today I’d like to focus on one kind of spending that can cause a wide range of emotional reactions, especially during the holiday season: Giving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Giving needs to be explored at a personal finance level because generosity is an important aspect of most people’s lives. I have found in my time as a Money Coach, there are clients that are willing to reduce expenses in a wide variety of areas in their lives, but will flat out refuse to eliminate or reduce their giving. And I understand that! Giving can be tied into who we are as people. We identify with the causes we give to, and it can feel miserly to stop or reduce giving. So let’s examine how giving can fit into our life, now and in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;my-personal-history-with-giving&quot;&gt;My personal history with giving&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently took a class from my mentor Luna Jaffe called &lt;a href=&quot;http://lunajaffe.com/wild-money/&quot;&gt;Wild Money&lt;/a&gt;. In this class she talked about six different aspects of personal finance: Receiving, Spending, Nurturing, Growing, Protecting, and Giving. I struggled more with the Giving section than I did with the other five sections &lt;strong&gt;combined&lt;/strong&gt;. I had some angry reactions to talking about generosity and giving. That in turn made me feel guilty and like I was a bad person. It turns out I’m and under-giver (more on under- and over-giving later) which means I don’t give as much as my life situation could allow, and I don’t give as much as I would like to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why is that? In the Wild Money class, we explored various reasons why I could be struggling so much with giving. Not until the very end of class did I realize that I have a couple of deep family dynamics that have conspired to make giving a difficult subject. My mother was, towards the end of her life, a very needy person. She would take from me, emotionally and financially, without regard for my ability to give, and I finally had to put some very firm boundaries between her and me in order to maintain my sanity. This led me to have some pretty complex feelings about what it means to give to people, especially those that need a lot of help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another dynamic I discovered is my family has a history of strings-attached giving. Again, this makes it hard for me to understand how a healthy, freely given gift looks and works. I have by no means fully worked through these issues, but just knowing they exist makes me realize I’m not just a bad person for my under-giving behaviors. And it gives me a basis to heal my relationship with giving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ask yourself, how was giving modeled in your family? Have you had times where giving was not healthy in your life? Do you connect giving with manipulation, as I do? Or does it stem from guilt or other negative feelings? Understanding your history can help you progress to a healthy relationship with giving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;giving-in-balance&quot;&gt;Giving in balance&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you continue to give, while healing your own financial situation? Like many things, I ascribe to the mantra of &lt;em&gt;balance&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example, let’s say you work for a non-profit, collecting donations for a cause you believe in. Every month, a woman comes in, and writes you a check for $500 dollars. It’s a generous gift, and you are always delighted to see her. One day, you notice she’s outside, arguing with a younger man, who walks away as she comes inside. As she opens her checkbook, she says, “my son is always trying to tell me what to do. He says I’m getting myself into debt because of this. But I don’t care, this cause is too important to stop.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How would this make you feel? Would you feel good that she is overextending herself in order to give to your cause? Or would you be sad that she is spending beyond her means, causing her and her family distress and strife?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You probably would want her to stop overextending herself, even though you yourself believe so strongly in your cause. Turn that back on yourself – do you give so much of yourself that you have nothing left for yourself?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;giving-from-abundance&quot;&gt;Giving from abundance&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I usually only recommend reducing your giving spending when your life is particularly out of balance: you either have far too little income to support your giving, or your giving is causing you to go into debt. You may have objections to reducing giving spending, but I want you to consider two things. The first is that this is only a temporary measure. The second is that we want to reduce your spending now so you can get your situation stable, so that you can spend more on giving later. When you are able to give from a place of abundance, you can give freely, and the gifts can do more good than if you are giving from a place of scarcity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;giving-creatively&quot;&gt;Giving creatively&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, if you need to reduce your giving, what should you do? You can continue to give while you are financially stretched, but it must be done creatively. You can give in various ways, but the two most common are: giving money, and giving time. If you are reducing your spending, then volunteering your time can be a rewarding way of giving of yourself. In fact, you may find that you like the hands-on nature of giving like this. You can dig into the details of causes that interest you, and find real reward by giving your time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-kind-of-giver-are-you&quot;&gt;What Kind of Giver Are You?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;you-give-beyond-your-means&quot;&gt;You give beyond your means&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you give beyond your means, it makes it harder to take care of yourself, which means it is going to be harder to give to others later. It can be difficult (or impossible!) for you to say no when someone needs something, even if you have nothing to give. Giving beyond your means will cause a sort of burnout, and can even lead to debt and other financial distress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;you-give-less-than-your-means&quot;&gt;You give less than your means&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you give less than your means, you are giving less than you could afford to, and more importantly you give less than your values would normally lead you to. It can cause anxiety and guilt, because you may know you aren’t spending your money according to your values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-do-people-give-out-of-balance-with-their-situation&quot;&gt;Why do people give out of balance with their situation?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There can be many reasons why people give out of balance from their means. Both over- and under-giving can be because of self-esteem issues: You don’t feel you have anything of worth to give, or perhaps you don’t feel &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt; are worth taking care of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Giving out of balance can also be because they are unclear in their financial situation. Or perhaps you so overwhelmed by the needs of the world, you shut down, and don’t give to anyone.
Remember, giving to yourself is giving too! Taking care of yourself helps those around you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding why you give out of balance to your means can help you understand how to change your situation. Listen to your heart! How can you best &lt;strong&gt;give&lt;/strong&gt; of yourself, after you have done enough to &lt;strong&gt;take care&lt;/strong&gt; of yourself first?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;a-one-week-exercise&quot;&gt;A One Week Exercise&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;if-you-give-more-than-your-means&quot;&gt;If you give more than your means&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a powerful exercises I learned from the Wild Money course. For one week, put yourself on a “giving fast”. Do not give money to anyone or anything. Every time you would normally give but don’t, write it down. Write down to whom, how much, and how it made you feel to not give that money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a week, you may be surprised by how you feel. One client told me she felt valuable and powerful. She started recognizing things she gives for that actually aren’t very well aligned to her values, because she didn’t have as strong an emotional reaction to not giving in those situations. Other things were clearly more aligned because it was quite painful to not give to them. At the end of the week, she went back to giving for those things she felt strongly about, and stopped the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another client noticed that she had to not help a friend out that she normally would have immediately given money to. She instead supported her friend emotionally as she looked for another way. As she watched this friend, she noticed she seemed to feel empowered that she had earned the money herself, instead of relying on a friend. The real gift was to allow her friend to work and grow on her own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;if-you-give-less-than-your-means&quot;&gt;If you give less than your means&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one week, commit to giving an amount of money every day. Give it to someone in need, like a homeless person, or to someone that it may delight. You can give a larger tip, or give to a charity. Whatever strikes your fancy that day. It could be $10, $20 or $50 a day. Whatever makes sense in your current financial situation. Every time you give that money away, write it down. Write who you gave it to, and how it made you feel to give the money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may find that giving regularly like this may bring up strong emotions, like it did for me. Whatever they are, write them down, and explore them further. They are probably trying to tell you something, maybe about your past, maybe about a misalignment between your behavior and your values. Whatever it is, try to follow it fully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting into the habit of giving can open up a world of gratitude. You can start seeing the world in terms of how you can help. You have value that can help others! What a powerful feeling!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;at-the-end-of-the-week&quot;&gt;At the end of the week&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of this exercise, look over what you wrote, and remember how you felt. Did you run into problems or strong emotions? Did you go back to your usual habits halfway through? Or did you feel content and happy? Whatever it was remember it and write it down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;whats-next&quot;&gt;What’s next?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important thing you can do is plan for her giving in your budget. Budgeting (especially &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/post/2017/11/22/Envelope-Budgeting.html&quot;&gt;Envelope Budgeting&lt;/a&gt;) will allow you to find a balance that will allow for sustained giving over the rest of your life. It can help you understand whether your are giving within your means and in balance with your life, and can help you understand whether your are giving according to your values. It can also help you see how your increasing financial stability can help you be a more generous and giving person, without neglecting your needs.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Envelope Budgeting</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Why do people have trouble starting and using a budget? I think it starts with two words – Forecasting and Rigidity. Think about how you probably budget (if you budget). Maybe you take a piece of paper (or a spreadsheet, or Mint. It doesn’t matter the tool, just the method) and write something like this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This months income: &lt;strong&gt;$3000&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This months expenses:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Groceries: $300&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rent: $1000&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Utilities: $40&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Entertainment: $100&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;…&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total: 2400&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first problem with budgeting like that is you are forecasting your income. In other words you wrote down money you don’t have, so you are starting the whole operation with a guess! Even if you have a reliable government job, you’re working with dollars that don’t yet belong to you. And that means that your budget is already starting off as a sort of theoretical document. What if instead you budgeted for all of your expenses using the money you already have? That shifts the conversation to something concrete. If I currently have $4000 in my bank accounts, then I can allocate that money to my expenses, and I know that right now, today, I could pay all of those bills and expenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Budgeting in the traditional way also is very rigid. At the end of the month how often did you actually hit those estimates for your expenses? I know I usually managed to blow at least one or two of them out of the water, which makes the whole rest of the budget suspect. If I overspent, where does that money come from? Do I take it from next month? I know that didn’t work, because I never would adjust my next months budget downward to compensate for it, if I even made it to a second month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before envelope budgeting, I would make a budget in a flurry of optimism, then by the middle of the month, I’d already have abandoned it. It was too theoretical and too rigid, and it made me feel bad that my life didn’t march to the perfect beat of my budget’s drum, rather then my budget flexing with my vibrant, dynamic life and changing priorities. And so I would just… give up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;how-does-envelope-budgeting-work&quot;&gt;How does envelope budgeting work?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Envelope budgeting asks you to gather all the money you have &lt;strong&gt;right now&lt;/strong&gt;. Then you take a pile of envelopes and label them with of all your bills, obligations, and nice-to-haves. Then you put money into each envelope, as much as you think you will need for that category until the next time you get more money. When you run out of money, you’re done budgeting. This method is also called “Zero-sum budgeting,” which means you budget every dollar you have, until you have zero money left to assign to an envelope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you then go to the grocery store, you would just grab your groceries envelope and take it with you. Whatever money you have in the envelope is the maximum you can spend. You still have to think ahead (“How many grocery trips do I need to take before the next time I get more money?”), but it keeps you from accidentally spending, say, your utility money on groceries, and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;living-in-the-now-and-flexibility&quot;&gt;Living in the now, and flexibility&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how does this method solve the forecasting and rigidity problems? Well, we aren’t forecasting, because we are only using money we currently have to plan our budget. And the flexibility comes in from the simplicity of the system. Lets say your brother calls you, and says he would like to stop by for dinner tomorrow night. You want to cook him a nice dinner, so you make a list of ingredients you will need to buy at the store. You estimate you’ll need $25 more than you’ve budgeted for groceries. What should you do? Maybe you would normally put it on a credit card, and promise yourself you’ll sort it out later. But since you’re working with envelopes and only the money you have right now, you decide to take the $25 out of your entertainment envelope. There, now you don’t have to remember that you need to scrimp a bit, it will be obvious, because your entertainment envelope has less money in it! Easy peasy, no shame, and no slowly and sneakily putting yourself into debt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;doesnt-it-sound-like-a-lot-of-work&quot;&gt;Doesn’t it sound like a lot of work!?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, yes it does. Envelope budgeting as a method was invented a while back, so using envelopes with cash was the easiest way to keep track. But now, most people use debit (or credit) cards for most of their transactions, so how can we implement the method in the modern world?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have found one program that implements envelope budgeting very well – &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ynab.com&quot;&gt;You Need A Budget&lt;/a&gt; (YNAB). It is an amazing program that is online, and has a mobile app, so when you are at the grocery store, you can pop open the app to see how much you have allocated to your groceries category (analogous to the envelope). They have a 34 day trial, and I highly encourage you to try it out. Their online tutorials and classes are amazing, and their support is top-notch, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;projecting-and-planning&quot;&gt;Projecting and planning&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing people ask me is, “Well, if we’re not supposed to forecast, how are we supposed to plan for the future?” When I use the word “forecasting,” I just mean planning our month using money we haven’t yet received. We can plan by using categories for our goals. Just like you will have a &lt;em&gt;Groceries&lt;/em&gt; category, you can have savings categories, like &lt;em&gt;New Car&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Emergency Fund&lt;/em&gt;. As you get money in, you can chose to add money to those categories. They will get bigger and bigger until you reach your goal, then you can spend it for its purpose, or, if like your &lt;em&gt;Emergency Fund&lt;/em&gt; its purpose is to sit there an act as a cushion, that’s fine, too. You don’t have to spend it, just like you don’t have to spend the money you have in an envelope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;final-thoughts&quot;&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve skipped over a few other issues I have with traditional budgeting. For example, we tend to be &lt;strong&gt;far&lt;/strong&gt; too optimistic about our expenses. But for now, this gets you started on a whole new way of thinking about your budget. Remember, you don’t need to feel bad if your life isn’t fitting your budget. Your budget is supposed to be flexible enough to change with your life, instead of making you feel bad for your priorities changing over time.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Five Whys</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the hardest part of repairing your relationship with money is understanding what the issue is in the first place. Is it something to do with your family history? Do you have a misalignment between your expenses and your values? Do you have different goals and ideas than your partner does, leading to friction and even fighting?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you trace your problems to an issue like the above, it can be really hard to dig into what’s really going on, and how to fix it. When I get stuck trying to figure out why I’m resistant to something I know would be good for me, I sit down with a blank sheet of paper and use the “Five Whys” technique. I write down the problem, then below write down “Why?”. When I write the answer, I write down “Why?” below that. Do that five times, and you may be getting close to the root cause. Here’s an example that I’m having trouble with right now:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I keep “stealing” from my savings account to pay for silly things like coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Because I like going to get coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Because I work alone, and it’s nice to be around people sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Because I’m an introvert, so I find it easier to go to a public place where I don’t really have to interact with people.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh boy, it’s starting to get hard now. Why don’t I want to work harder on being out with people?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Well… it’s so hard to connect with my old friends when they work a regular J.O.B. Also, I feel like I’m not able to work when I’m alone.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I’m afraid I’m not getting enough done with starting my new business. I feel guilty that I don’t have more to tell my friends about how I’m doing. I don’t want to confront failure, so it’s easier to be alone among people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ahhhh, now I’m starting to get somewhere. And it’s not at all where I expected this to go! In the fourth why I gave two different answers, so I chose to go with the first one for now. It’s worth it to go back and do this again with the second answer, because I may uncover some more interesting tidbits. Bt right now, I wanted to explore my first answer. I’m basically spending money on coffee because I’m afraid of failure. This is something that is way more addressable then my original frustration. How do I confront this fear of failure, instead of drowning it in coffee? That’s a post for another time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;final-thoughts&quot;&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this simple technique helps you dig further into your personal issues with money. Remember, personal finance is mostly  about the personal, less about the finance. When you are emotionally equipped to deal with your finances, they tend to start falling into line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: you can find out more about the history of this technique on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Welcome to Financial Freedom!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a money coach. I help people understand their personal finances, align their financial situation with their values, and help create financial peace for themselves and their families.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the largest gaps in education at all ages and levels is personal finance. Money is important in all facets of our lives, and yet how many of us have had classes or education in how to manage our money? I’m willing to bet that very few of those of you reading this have had any kind of formal or informal education in personal money management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may have been taught what you know by your parents, either by what they’ve told you, or just by observing their behavior from afar. Maybe you watched them argue about money, or make poor decisions. Maybe you saw them make great decisions, but you don’t know why or how you made them, so you can’t replicate their success yourself. Whatever it may be, I can help. I can teach you how to budget (there’s that big bad word!), but not to limit you, but instead budget from a place of freedom and flexibility. I believe that your budget should follow and support your life, not be a rigid instrument to beat you up when you don’t “follow” it properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will create a series of weekly articles, tips and tricks for how to get control of your finances, without having to be a math wiz, and without feeling guilty about your past or your decisions. Sign up in the box to the right to get these articles straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;— Cecilia Case, Money Coach&lt;/p&gt;
