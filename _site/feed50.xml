        <title>The Three Pillars to a Healthy Relationship with Money</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Last post, I talked about &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/post/2019/01/30/Three-Symptoms-Of-Money-Issues.html&quot;&gt;the three symptoms of money issues&lt;/a&gt;. If you think you have a problem with your money, the next question becomes, what can you do about it? So today I’d like to talk a little about the three pillars to concentrate on when healing your relationship with money. This will give you a good base to start understanding the steps you’ll need to take.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Five Steps to Thrive with Variable Income</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Everyone, I’m so excited that I have been accepted to write a blog post for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.womenwithmoxie.com&quot;&gt;Women With Moxie&lt;/a&gt;! You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.womenwithmoxie.com/five-steps-to-thrive-with-variable-income/&quot;&gt;read it there&lt;/a&gt; and I have reposted here!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had been working on my own relationship with money for a few years before I decided to become a Money Coach and start my own business. I had been through highs and lows, made mistakes, and had personal triumphs. I felt pretty good about my relationship with money and was out of debt, so I figured starting my own business wouldn’t change things that much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was wrong!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Fight the Overwhelm</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I hear a lot of different emotions when I talk with my clients. Money is so connected to most parts of our lives that it is actually very difficult to separate it from how we conduct our lives, and the events that go on in our lives. We work to get money, which we then turn around and spend, both on things that are deeply important to us, and on things that are of almost no importance at all. And sometimes that wheel gets to be going faster and faster, until we feel like we might fly right off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;That’s overwhelm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>My yearly review</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned last year, I’m not big on New Year Resolutions. But making goals and reviewing them is very important and can really clarify your values and your money situation. The past few years, I’ve done an informal, high level yearly review of my financial situation, and it’s really helped me gain a perspective of how my goals change over time. I’d like to share with you my 2018 review.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;We’re getting close to the end of the year! Now is a great time to take a beat, and look back on what we did last year, and what we want to do next year. After the new year dawns, I’ll tell you a little bit about my personal retrospective and goals for 2019, but first, take a little time to look backwards and forwards with your money life, so you’re ready to take on 2019!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why the taboo against talking about money hurts you</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I don’t think I’m saying anything too controversial when I say that our society in America has a taboo against talking about money. We all run into situations where talking about how much we make, how much we spend, or how much debt we are in is just &lt;em&gt;not talked about&lt;/em&gt;. I’m no expert on sociology, but I think these taboos are instilled very early in our lives, and they are sometimes buried very deeply, so deeply that when we pause and ask ourselves “Why?” the answer is often “Because it’s rude” or “Because that is what is always done”.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Stop budgeting, start holding up your Money Mirror</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;What feelings come up when I say the word “Budget”? If you are like most people, the words are often negative: restrictive, guilt, shame, hard, daunting, discouraging. I completely understand those emotions and feelings. I have had most of them myself with regard to this bad word: &lt;strong&gt;budget&lt;/strong&gt;. Why is it we are all told to budget, but then most of us have such negative feelings surrounding the process?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Draw Strength From Your Tribe</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Do you have nieces? I do, and they are amazing. Every time I see them, they remind me of the fearless person I was when I was a child, the person I always aspire to be now. My lovely sister has invited me to their soccer games, and every weekend I sit there on the sidelines watching, learning more about them, every single wet morning.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What is a Normal Month?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;What is a Normal Month? Take a moment to think about what that means to you. Does it mean that you are spending exactly what you expect on your bills? Does it mean that you have no surprise expenses? Does it mean that you are able to pay your groceries in full, and have a little left over?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Receiving Money Into Your Life</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There once was a girl who got her first job out of high school. She had applied for a job as a sales clerk at the local department store, and she was so proud of herself when she was hired. She had put in the work to have a good resume, and did very well on the interview. She was nervous about her new job, but she knew she could do a good job. But…&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Aging Your Money</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It has been so long since I have written on here! I’m glad to say, I’m back, and this will be the final post for the YNAB Series. So let’s get started on the last YNAB Rule!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you read the &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/post/2018/02/07/Make-Your-Budget-Fit-Your-Life.html&quot;&gt;article “Make Your Budget Fit Your Life”&lt;/a&gt;, you’re beginning to see that the best budget is one that flexes with your life. We want a budget that works with us, rather then making us feel bad for not fitting into a rigid box. So what is the last rule? And what does it mean?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Make Your Budget Fit Your Life</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If you’ve read the &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/post/2018/01/31/What-Are-True-Expenses.html&quot;&gt;article last week&lt;/a&gt;, you know how to why it is important to embrace your true expenses, and what they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we know about Giving Every Dollar a Job, and Embracing our True Expenses, the next rule is Roll With the Punches, which is my favorite rule, because it is what transforms YNAB from an expense tracker to a guilt and shame free budget planner, and allows your budget to fit your life, instead of trying to fit your life to your budget.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What are True Expenses?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If you’ve read the &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/post/2018/01/24/Give-Every-Dollar-A-Job.html&quot;&gt;article last week&lt;/a&gt;, you know that you need to give your dollars jobs, but how do you decide what jobs are necessary in your life?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You use the second YNAB rule to figure that out. “Embrace Your True Expenses” tells us that we need to fully understand our expenses, and not just the regular bills.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What is the Purpose of Your Money?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;What do you want your money to do for you? Do you want to travel the world with it, or buy a house for your family? What about taking art classes, or donating to causes you believe in? Is there something stopping you from achieving those goals? I know that for years, I never felt like I could save for those things, because I didn’t know if I had enough money. I didn’t know where my money was going, so I was afraid to use it for anything more then bills. If you are worried about covering your bills, then how can you set money aside for the bigger goals?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the second article in the YNAB Series, and I’m going to talk about YNAB’s first rule – Give Every Dollar a Job.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>YNAB - My budgeting software of choice</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Budgeting is the foundation of building a wonderful and stable financial life. But I don’t like the way budgeting is usually taught, when it is taught at all. Forecasting and rigidity are common problems that you may have encountered in trying to budget. &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/post/2017/11/22/Envelope-Budgeting.html&quot;&gt;Envelope Budgeting&lt;/a&gt; is something I have recommended before, and I mentioned &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ynab.com&quot;&gt;YNAB (You Need A Budget)&lt;/a&gt; as my software of choice to implement envelope budgeting. Let’s dig into YNAB, see what it can give us.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My yearly review</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned last week, I’m not big on New Year Resolutions. But I do think it is important to make goals, and track our progress. The past few years, I’ve done an informal, high level yearly review of my financial situation, and it’s really helped me gain a perspective of how my goals change over time. I’d like to share with you my 2017 review.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Happy New Year! Welcome to the new year of financial bliss!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to 2018! I am so excited for the new year! 2017 was a year filled with changes for me, and I am excited to see what comes to fruition and what still needs work. I am not one for New Year’s Resolutions, but I know they can be very helpful to motivate people to &lt;strong&gt;get started&lt;/strong&gt; with something great. Getting started is often the hardest part of any worthy endeavor. Do you have any resolutions related to money?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe you want to get out of debt, or increase your savings? Or perhaps you want to start saving for a down payment, or buy a car with cash for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever your goals, I can help you get started! The foundation to achieving your money goals is creating a budget that works with your life, your values, and your goals. Please contact me if you would like guided and personalized coaching to help you achieve your goals in 2018!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Guilt and Shame</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Do you feel guilty about your money past? Perhaps you’ve made a bad investment, or haven’t invested at all. Maybe someone you trusted someone stole money from you, or you have a spending addiction. Whatever it is, we all have times that we have made bad decisions involving money, and that can lead to all sorts of negative emotions – guilt, anger, betrayal, shame, and more. What’s worse, over time it can leave you feeling in doubt of your own ability to manage money.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What To Do When Your Expenses are more than your Income!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So you’ve &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/post/2017/12/13/Bare-Bones-Number.html&quot;&gt;Calculated your Bare Bones Number&lt;/a&gt; and you know that your expenses are larger than your income. What do you do now? The first thing is, pause and honor yourself taking an open-eyed look at your situation. You can’t fix an issue if you don’t even know it exists, so congratulate yourself for understanding where you stand right now.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What Is Your Bare Bones Number?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Do you know what financial level you are living at? Are you living close to the bone, or are you living freely, with all of your needs &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; your wants being met? And how do you know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When clients come to me to get their finances under control, one of the first things I do is help them to understand their “Bare Bones Number.” My mentor &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lunajaffe.com&quot;&gt;Luna Jaffe&lt;/a&gt; likes to call it the “Squeak-By Number,” because it’s the number that you would be just squeaking by on. It is the minimum amount of money you could spend every month, to just barely get by.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Credit Card Float</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There’s a hidden debt trap that you could be falling into. I know I sound like one of those terrible commercials trying to persuade you to give them money to get your debt cancelled. But there &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; a way to get into debt without knowing you are in debt, and it is called “Credit Card Float.”&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Balance Giving with Budgeting</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When we explore our money life, we dig deep into our bills, essentials like groceries, debt payments, and discretionary spending. But today I’d like to focus on one kind of spending that can cause a wide range of emotional reactions, especially during the holiday season: Giving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Giving needs to be explored at a personal finance level because generosity is an important aspect of most people’s lives. I have found in my time as a Money Coach, there are clients that are willing to reduce expenses in a wide variety of areas in their lives, but will flat out refuse to eliminate or reduce their giving. And I understand that! Giving can be tied into who we are as people. We identify with the causes we give to, and it can feel miserly to stop or reduce giving. So let’s examine how giving can fit into our life, now and in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Envelope Budgeting</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Why do people have trouble starting and using a budget? I think it starts with two words – Forecasting and Rigidity. Think about how you probably budget (if you budget). Maybe you take a piece of paper (or a spreadsheet, or Mint. It doesn’t matter the tool, just the method) and write something like this&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Five Whys</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the hardest part of repairing your relationship with money is understanding what the issue is in the first place. Is it something to do with your family history? Do you have a misalignment between your expenses and your values? Do you have different goals and ideas then your partner does, leading to friction and even fighting?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Welcome to Financial Freedom!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a money coach. I help people understand their personal finances, align their financial situation with their values, and help create financial peace for themselves and their families.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the largest gaps in education at all ages and levels is personal finance. Money is important in all facets of our lives, and yet how many of us have had classes or education in how to manage our money? I’m willing to bet that very few of those of you reading this have had any kind of formal or informal education in personal money management.&lt;/p&gt;
