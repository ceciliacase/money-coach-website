        <title>Is Debt a Universal Constant?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;“I’ll be in debt until I die.”
“Everyone is in debt.”
“I’ll always have a car loan. I can’t afford to buy a car with cash!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Debt is a universal constant, never to be escaped and never to be changed, like Death and Taxes, right? Over the years, I’ve noticed that there seems to be a large group of people out there that accept debt as a constant in their lives that can never be eliminated. “Well, that’s just the way it is, right? I have to get a loan to get a car. And by the time I pay this one off, I’ll need a new car, with a new loan.” But is that really true? Is debt really inevitable?&lt;/p&gt;
