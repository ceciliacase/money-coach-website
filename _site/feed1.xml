        <title>Five Steps to Thrive with Variable Income</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Everyone, I’m so excited that I have been accepted to write a blog post for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.womenwithmoxie.com&quot;&gt;Women With Moxie&lt;/a&gt;! You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.womenwithmoxie.com/five-steps-to-thrive-with-variable-income/&quot;&gt;read it there&lt;/a&gt; and I have reposted here!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had been working on my own relationship with money for a few years before I decided to become a Money Coach and start my own business. I had been through highs and lows, made mistakes, and had personal triumphs. I felt pretty good about my relationship with money and was out of debt, so I figured starting my own business wouldn’t change things that much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was wrong!&lt;/p&gt;
