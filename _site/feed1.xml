        <title>The Bank Of Mom And The Bank Of Dad</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As I have been working with the great people at &lt;a href=&quot;http://debt-payoff-planner.com&quot;&gt;Debt Payoff Planner&lt;/a&gt;, we have been having fun looking through data. One thing they pointed out to me was some interesting statistics relating to family loans. Often these loans are from a parent, which isn’t surprising, but something that did surprise me is some of them have an interest rate. In other words, the parents are charging their kids for their loans, which I found really surprising. Let’s dig into the data a bit more, and find out who lends their kids more often, Mom or Dad? And who charges more?&lt;/p&gt;
