        <title>Why do most businesses fail? A perspective from a bookkeeper</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today is a big day for us here at Bountiful Money! Iâ€™m here to introduce you to Charissa Samco with Above LLC. She is the first guest poster on my blog. I met Charissa through a local bookkeeping networking group here in Portland called Portland Woodard Group, and we just hit it off! She has such a fantastic outlook towards the bookkeeping profession, and I love her kindness and dedication to the success of her clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last time we met, she made a startling and saddening observation - she has had to help several of her clients wrap up and close their businesses this last year, and she noticed a pattern. So if you are a small business owner, or thinking about starting your own business, I want you to read what she has to say!&lt;/p&gt;
