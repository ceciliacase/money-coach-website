    <p>Here are a few things my clients are saying!</p>

<div class="review">

  <div class="review-overlay" id="review-overlay-1" onclick="off(1)">
    <div class="review-text"><p>Before we started working with Cecilia we thought we had it all figured out. We weren’t paying any interest on our credit cards and were saving a little. The problem was that we were living off <a href="http://localhost:4000/post/2017/12/06/Credit-Card-Float.html">credit card float</a>. If at any moment our income stopped coming in, we would find ourselves a month behind, unable to pay our credit card <em>and</em> pay for our current expenses. This was especially problematic because we were working towards my husband taking off the summer to spend it with our daughters. We had NO idea where our money was going each month.</p>

<p>After a few months working with Cecilia, we eliminated our float, started saving toward those pesky ‘gotcha’ items like repairs or annual fees (YUCK!) and were able to have my husband take 5 months off, stress-free, to spend with our girls and volunteer at school. We never would have been able to manage this without Cecilia and YNAB. There is no way we could thank her enough!</p>

<div class="review">

  <div class="review-overlay" id="review-overlay-2" onclick="off(2)">
    <div class="review-text"><p>I have been in the financial industry for over 15 years now doing everything from credit cards to mortgages to underwriting, so I have always felt like a had a good grasp on my own finances and what I thought was budgeting. When I realized I was drowning in my debt and was barely living paycheck to paycheck, I reached out.</p>

<p>Cecilia and I have been working together on healing my relationship with money for a few months now. At first, I was extremely excited to dive right into the lessons and budgeting portion. But quickly felt overwhelmed when I realized my grasp on my own finances was barely hanging by a string. Having weekly coaching sessions with Cecilia has not only helped my anxieties and frustrations but has also helped me get some clarity on how deeply rooted this is.</p>

<p>Cecilia’s patience and understanding to my personal situation is beyond words. In addition to encouraging conversations, she takes the time to acknowledge the “win” in situations that have gotten the best of me. She also makes sure to explain things in a way that I make sense to me. Trying to over 30 years of bad habits and rocky relationships with money is going to be a bit of a rocky road, but I am feeling 100% confident having Cecilia by my side.</p>

<p>I would recommend this program to anyone at any level. Whether you are just starting your financial journey in life or you think you are a seasoned financial veteran like I thought. It has been extremely beneficial to me so far, (not just because I have been able to pay off 3 debts so far) and I am looking forward to the rest of the journey.</p>

    <div class="review-text"><p>It’s been a magical and miraculous 2018, and I wanted to thank you again for your assistance in my financial make-over. As a single, self-employed woman, I’ve struggled with my finances and balancing a budget. Now I actually enjoy budgeting and keeping track of my money with YNAB! It feels amazing to have this kind of financial stability for the first time in my life! I’m very grateful for your time, expertise and coaching to master YNAB, and being an integral part of my fabulous financial transformation.</p>

    ...I have money growing in my savings, retirement account, and set aside for my quarterly taxes. My credit card is paid off in full each month. The most amazing and magical gift was paying my student loans off in full. A tremendous weight has been lifted from my shoulders...

<div class="review">

  <div class="review-overlay" id="review-overlay-4" onclick="off(4)">
    <div class="review-text"><p>I have great news!! I opened up all my accounts to my new husband and showed him all my hard work with the budget!! He is very relieved I finally have a system and I seem to know what I am doing. He was so impressed he is considering moving all his financial tracking over too!</p>

<p>And together we have sat down with each of the children and walked them through YNAB for their personal use and it is now a requirement to have their budgets up to date and maintained before receiving monthly allowances!! This is moving exactly how I hoped and it is such a relief to finally know what I am talking about and have an intuitive system that makes it easy for the process to continue.</p>

<p>It feels like I am in a great spot and this experience has literally been life changing.</p>

    <div class="review-text"><p>This is the third budgeting course I’ve taken with Cecilia and the past three months have been personally transformative as a result! I began the process feeling a lot of anxiety about money and my finances after getting divorced, but after the first few classes it all suddenly felt manageable. Cecilia has a way of making you feel comfortable in class and she is skilled at facilitating difficult conversations with a lot of sensitivity (i.e. managing debt). She is able to explain budgeting in simple terms and make it all fun at the same time. I highly recommend her as a teacher!</p>

    <div class="review-text"><p>From how I deal with it to how I use it, my relationship with money is getting better thanks in large part to Cecilia.  I have worked with Cecilia during the first and second budget classes and have really enjoyed her approach, thoughtfulness and willingness to engage me and support my learning and growth. Cecilia is smart and enthusiastic and I would recommend taking the time to work with her when making important investments in yourself.</p>
