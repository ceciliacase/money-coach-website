## Save Money
I know what it's like to constantly fall into a debt cycle, or worry about paying your bills in your paycheck-to-paycheck life, and never be able to save for what you really want in your life. Together we will learn what makes you go into debt, and change our relationship with money so you are spending within your means, and saving for your goals.

## Budget According to Your Values
Budgeting is often thought of as a restrictive process, designed to constrict you and make you feel guilty. I teach a dynamic budgeting process that frees you, allowing you to spend your money in alignment with your values and life goals.

## Experience Financial Bliss!
We will work with old money patterns, understanding them and replacing patterns that no longer serve you. We will work to create a new, healthy relationship with money, where you are in control, and you are living your life according to your values!

# Partners and Couples
If you have a partner that you combine money with, I highly encourage you to invest in the couples sessions. It is very advantageous for both members of a partnership to learn budgeting at the same time, and have the opportunity to ask questions and get their needs met within the sessions. Those couples I have taught together seem to feel more in tune and comfortable with the process.
The content for the couples sessions are similar, and you will together on your budget for the duration of the class. Some of the content will expand on concepts like the pros and cons of maintaining separate accounts, how to honor each other's goals and values, and how to work together to increase communication and reduce friction in the relationship due to money worries.
