## Budget According to Your Values
Budgeting is often thought of as a restrictive process, designed to constrict you and make you feel guilty. I teach a dynamic budgeting process that frees you, allowing you to spend your money in alignment with your values and life goals.

## Save Money
I know what it's like to constantly fall into a debt cycle, or worry about paying your bills in your paycheck-to-paycheck life, and never be able to save for what you really want in your life. Together we will learn what makes you go into debt, and change our relationship with money so you are spending within your means, and saving for your goals.

## Experience Financial Bliss!
We will work with old money patterns, understanding them and replacing patterns that no longer serve you. We will work to create a new, healthy relationship with money, where you are in control, and you are living your life according to your values!

# How to work with me
My 6 month <b>Heal Your Relationship With Money</b> program includes four 60-minute coaching sessions by phone each month for six months. We will use that time to explore your money past, your unique money challenges, and to get feedback or a sounding board on developing your new strategies and relationship with money.

Our work together in the Program will focus on helping you 
- Heal your relationship with money
- Create a plan for debt elimination and set up savings goals based on your values
- Create strategies for working with your partner about money in harmony OR create a business budget for your small business. 

You will also get access to a comprehensive program of video lessons, worksheets, guided journaling and more. You'll get support with implementation of all of the above during the 6 months of the program.

This is a truely transformative program at the end of the six months, you will have a new perspective on your money life, and control over your financial destiny!
