I offer a one month package and a three month package with weekly meetings, and daily work to help you develop your financial practice. I also offer additional individual sessions for brush-ups, semi-yearly check-ups, or more advanced questions and topics.

Here is the general outline of what we will work on, which will be customized as we go to address your specific financial situation, education, and values:

## First month
We will explore your current financial situation, and your goals using a worksheet that will be sent to you prior to your first session.

I will guide you in creating a budget that will be tailored to your needs and goals, and go through the process of how to maintain your budget to create financial clarity and freedom.

We will also spend time talking about your financial background and how that can affect your relationship to money, and work on strategies to a healthier relationship with money.

## Second month
We will define your values, and work on expanding and changing your budget to reflect your values best, so you know your money is always going to the things and experiences that mean the most to you. 

The previous month was about building a foundation of what your financial picture is right now. This second month is about using your budget to make the future you see for yourself.

We will also expand on any topics that you want to next concentrate on, like debt reduction, saving for retirement, saving for kids college, or starting a business.

## Third month
We will work on advanced concepts, like reports, separate budgets, including small-business budgets, simplifying accounts, improving your credit score, estate planning, and other topics that we have uncovered in previous sessions.

We will also work together to help you establish your budgeting as a lifelong practice, that will continue to help you meet your goals in the years to come.

As advanced students, these sessions are often directed by your needs and questions. 

# Partners and Couples
If you have a partner that you combine money with, I highly encourage you to invest in the couples sessions. It is very advantageous for both members of a partnership to learn budgeting at the same time, and have the opportunity to ask questions and get their needs met within the sessions. Those couples I have taught together seem to feel more in tune and comfortable with the process.

The content for the couples sessions are similar, and you will work with one unified budget for the duration of the class. Some of the content will expand on concepts like the pros and cons of maintaining separate accounts, how to honor each other's goals and values, and how to work together to increase communication and reduce friction in the relationship due to money worries.

# Pricing
For the individualized coaching help I provide, I have to following pricing packages. If you a customized program or specific issue you would like to work on, please mention it in your initial phone consulation, and I will make sure to include it.

# Refunds
I absolutely will issue full refunds to anyone who is not satisfied with their services. I do ask two things - That you take all of the classes, and that you participate fully in all the at-home activities and exercises that we work on. I believe that I provide value to those that are willing to work hard, so I want to make sure that you have fully committed to my coaching, and to your improvement of your financial situation. If you have completed one of my packages, and worked hard at the activities I have assigned, and you still feel you have not received the value you thought you were going to get, I will give a full refund for your package.
