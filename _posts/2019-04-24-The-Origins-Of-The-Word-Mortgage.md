I ran across a little piece of information recently that stopped me in my tracks. Did you know that the word *mortgage* translates to *death contract (or pledge)* in French? Wow! If you are anything like me, that provokes a strong emotional reaction.

To me, debts are a powerful tool, like a sharp knife. It can be used as a tool, but it can also cause great damage and so they must be used cautiously and respect for the power they imply. And a mortgage is a good example of that power -- the power to get you into a house now, while also creating a responsibility that will last for thirty years.

I've read that a mortgage is so called because the deal dies either when the debt is paid, or when payment fails, which makes some sense, and is a bit less dramatic than the implication. But I don't think it is an accident that such dramatic language is used to describe a debt. Does the term "death contract" change how you feel about your debts?
