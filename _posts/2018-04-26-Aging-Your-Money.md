It has been so long since I have written on here! I'm glad to say, I'm back, and this will be the final post for the YNAB Series. So let's get started on the last YNAB Rule!

If you read the [article "Make Your Budget Fit Your Life"]({{ site.url }}{% post_url 2018-02-07-Make-Your-Budget-Fit-Your-Life %}), you're beginning to see that the best budget is one that flexes with your life. We want a budget that works with us, rather then making us feel bad for not fitting into a rigid box. So what is the last rule? And what does it mean?

OK, we've covered the three most fundamental rules:
1. **Give Every Dollar A Job**, which reminds us that we need to work with the reality of the dollars we have right now.
2. **Embrace Your True Expenses**, which tells us that we need to account for every type of expense we have, not just your bills, and including your savings goals.
3. **Roll With The Punches**, which gives you permission to change your budget when you need to, and gives you a safe way to do so.


# Age Your Money
The last rule is "Age Your Money." You can find the age of your money in the upper-right hand corner of the screen in YNAB:

Aging Your Money means that we want to hold onto money for longer and longer periods of time. If you are living paycheck to paycheck, when you spend a dollar the day you got paid, that dollar is considered one day old. But if you hold onto that dollar until the next day, it will be two days old, and so on. So when we talk about aging your money, we are saying that we are living on dollars that we earned some time ago. And old money is good, because it means that we have savings, and are breaking out of the paycheck-to-paycheck cycle.

The fourth rule, incidentally, used to be "Live on Last Month's Income". With that rule, the goal was to age your money to at least 30 days old. So when you spent your money, it would have been money you earned last month. That was a pretty binary and rigid rule though, and it make it hard to see your progress, so now you can take it day by day, and increase the age of your money gradually, celebrating your progress as your money gets older. I still recommend setting 30 days as a good goal, though, because if you have 30 days, you've officially broken the paycheck-to-paycheck cycle, which is really an amazing accomplishment.
 
I think that Aging Your Money is a fantastic goal. But I also think it is OK not to concentrate on it. You may put a high priority on paying down debt, or contributing to savings goals. By all means, feel free to ignore the number in the upper-right hand corner of your screen. If you are working the first three rules, the fourth rule will start to come to you naturally.
