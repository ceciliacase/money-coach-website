I was reading this [excellent article](https://www.youneedabudget.com/four-myths-that-could-be-holding-you-back-financially) from the team at [YNAB](https://www.ynab.com), and it really resonated with me. Back when I was healing my own relationship with money, I encountered all sorts of resistance from others any time I mentioned budgeting. "Eh, I have enough money, I don't need to track it." Or on the other side: "I don't have enough money to budget." "Budgeting cramps my style," or the reverse, "budgeting makes me feel bad about myself." Now let me say, not everyone *has* to budget. But I know that even for those that aren't paycheck-to-paycheck, or deeply in debt, budgeting can still revolutionize personal finances for most people, if done well.

You may have seen my previous article on [why people think budgets are restrictive]({% post_url 2018-11-21-Stop-Budgeting%}) (spoiler: most budget methods **are** restrictive!) But budgets don't have to be that way! You can create budgets that are flexible, friendly, and aligned with your values. And if your budget is like that, many of the old excuses melt away!
# I don't have enough (or have too much) money to budget
Nonsense. Here's a little secret - good budgets don't track your money, they track your **goals**. Do you have goals? Great! Then you can use a budget to maintain, track and attain your goals, at least as the pertain to money! Do you want to get out of paycheck-to-paycheck? Great budgets help with that. Do you want to make sure your money is making the maximum impact in your life? Fantastic! No matter what that looks like, whether it be retirement investing, saving for the luxuries in life, or creating a charitable foundation, budgeting is the first step!
