I am so honored! I held the first Money Empowerment Monthly meeting last week, and it was so fantastic! I had a chance to share the three keys to how to heal your relationship with money, and I had a blast! I got to present to an amazing group of folks in all of stages of life that are ready to transform their money relationship. I can't believe how fantastic they all were, and I'm so excited for the next meeting. Going forward, the meeting is going to be a roundtable discussion. Bring your most pressing money issue or your most recent money success and I will facilitate an open discussion. We will talk about your money stories in a safe space, get support from others, and find new solutions to your money woes. 

[Money Empowerment Monthly](https://www.meetup.com/Money-Empowerment-Monthly/) is designed to be an open and safe environment for people to get together and help each other change their relationship with money. If you are in Portland or know someone who is, I would like to invite you to the next meeting November 28th at 5:30pm at CENTRL Eastside. It is $15 if you sign up early, and $20 at the door!
