I have a theory why most people have trouble keeping a budget going, and it starts with two words -- Forecasting and Rigidity.


To expand on this we need to talk about how we're usually taught to budget. Normally I see people take a piece of paper (or a spreadsheet, or Mint. It doesn't matter the tool, just the method) and write something like this

This months income: **$3000**

This months expenses:

- Groceries: $300
- Rent: $1000
- Utilities: $40
- Entertainment: $100
- ...
- **Total: 2400**

So what's wrong with budgeting like this? Well, for one thing you're forecasting your income. You don't actually know you will have that money available. Even if you have an amazingly reliable government job, you're still working with dollars that don't yet belong to you. And that means that your budget is already starting off as a sort of theoretical document. What if instead you budgeted for all of your expenses using **the money you already have**? That shifts the conversation to something concrete. If I currently have $4000 in my bank accounts, then I can allocate that money to all of my expenses, and I know that right now, today, I could pay all of my bills for the month, and pay my other expenses as well.

Budgeting like that also is very rigid. At the end of the month how often did you actually hit those estimates for your expenses? I know I usually managed to blow at least one or two of them out of the water, which makes the whole rest of the budget suspect. If I overspent, where does that money come from? Do I take it from next month? I know that I never would adjust my next months budget downward to compensate for it, if I even made it to a second month. Which means the budgets are really not all that useful, because they aren't reflecting the dynamic nature of our lives very well.

Before Zero-sum budgeting, I would make a budget in a flurry of optimism, then by the middle of the month, I'd have already abandoned it. It was too theoretical and too rigid, and it made me feel bad that my life didn't march to the perfect beat of my budget's drum, rather then my budget flexing with my life and changing priorities

# How does zero-sum budgeting work?
Zero-sum budgeting asks you to take the sum of all the money you have **right now**, and list that. Then you take a list of all your bills, obligations, and nice-to-haves and start going down the list, assigning each dollar you currently have to one of those categories. Another name for zero-sum budgeting is "Envelope Budgeting", because you can take a pile of envelopes, put labels on each, "groceries," "rent," "entertainment" and so on, and put money into the envelopes. When you run out of money, you're done budgeting. That's the "Zero" part of zero-sum budgeting. If you chose to do it with envelopes, when you go to the grocery store, you would just grab your groceries envelope and take it with you. Whatever money you have in the envelope is the maximum you can spend. You still have to think ahead ("How many grocery trips do I need to take before the next time I get more money?"), but it keeps you from accidentally spending your utilities money on groceries, and vice versa.

# Living in the now, and flexibility
So how does this method solve the forecasting and rigidity problems? Well, we aren't forecasting, because we are only using money we currently have to plan our budget. And the flexibility comes in from the simplicity of the system. Lets say some family calls you, and says they are unexpectedly stopping by for dinner tomorrow night. You want to throw them a nice dinner, so you make a list of ingredients you will need to buy at the store. Perhaps it looks like you'll need $50 more then you've budgeted for groceries. What should you? Maybe you would normally put it on a credit card, and promise yourself you'll sort it out later. But since we're working with envelopes, you decide to take the $50 out of your Entertainment envelope. There, now you don't have to remember that you need to scrimp a bit, it will be obvious to you, because your envelope has less money in it! Easy peasy, no shame, no slowly and sneakily putting yourself into debt.

# Doesn't it sound like a lot of work!?
Well yes, it does. zero-sum budgeting as a method was invented quite a while ago, so using envelopes was the easiest way to keep track. But now in days, most people use debit cards for most of their transactions, so how can we implement the method instead?

I have found only one program that implements zero-sum budgeting well -- [You Need A Budget](www.ynab.com) (YNAB). It is an amazing program that is online, and also has a mobile app, so when you are at the grocery store, you can pop open the app to see how much you have allocated to your groceries category (analogous to the envelope). They have a 34 day trial, and I highly encourage you to try it out. Their online tutorials and classes are amazing, and their support is top-notch, too.

# Projecting and planning
Another thing people ask me is, "Well, if we're not supposed to forecast, how are we supposed to plan for the future?" And that is a great question. But remember, when I use the word "forecasting," I just mean planning our month using money we haven't yet received. I still want us to plan, and we do that by using categories for our goals. Just like you will have a "Groceries" category, you can have savings categories, like "New Car" or "Emergency Fund". As you get money in, you can chose to add money to those categories. They will get bigger and bigger until you reach your goal, then you can spend it for its purpose, or if, like "Emergency Fund", its purpose is to sit there an act as a cushion, that's fine, too.

# Final thoughts
I've glossed over a few other issues I have with traditional budgeting. For example, we tend to be **far** too optimistic about our expenses. And why is it so important to assign every single dollar to a category? But for now, I think this gets you started on a whole new way of thinking about your budget. Remember, you don't need to feel bad if your life isn't fitting your budget. Your budget is supposed to be flexible enough to change with your life, instead of making you feel bad for your priorities changing over time.
