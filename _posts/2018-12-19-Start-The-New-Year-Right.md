We're getting close to the end of the year! Now is a great time to take a beat, and look back on what we did last year, and what we want to do next year. After the new year dawns, I'll tell you a little bit about my personal retrospective and goals for 2019, but first, take a little time to look backwards and forwards with your money life.

Now is a great time to take out a piece of paper, or open a new document on your computer, and answer a few questions:  
* What were your financial goals last year?
* Did you meet those goals?
* What unexpected paths did your life take?
* Looking forward, what goals would you like to set down for 2019?

Put the piece of paper in a safe place that you'll be able to find next year. I even put an appointment item on my calendar for the first week of every year, to remind myself to pull out my old goals and review my year, then make those new goals!

I like doing this exercise, because I think it is wonderful to celebrate things we have done throughout the year, but also because I like to celebrate the twists and turns my life has taken. There's nothing to be ashamed of for not accomplishing our goals, especially if it came about because we took some other wonderful turn in our life. 

**Celebrate the wins, but also relish the complexity and beauty of a life well lived!**
