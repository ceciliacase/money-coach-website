My money story has been fraught with wrong turns, struggles, and poor choices. In particular, I had written a money story a long time ago as a child, that financial insecurity was to be avoided at all costs. If I had a choice before me and one would make me happy, and the other would make me feel safe about money, I chose safe every time. That was a story I had to change to take the next step in my money life. But that is not what this article is about. This is about what I learned when I started my own business. And that is this: If I thought managing my money was hard when I had a stable paycheck, try doing it with variable income!

When I was budgeting with a stable salary, I had to deal with varying expenses, nasty surprises, and changing priorities all the time. But when I became a small business owner, everything became variable, both coming in, and going out. I didn't know how much money I was going to have to even budget with, so how could I make decisions at all?

This is the complex realm of variable income, and it can seem insurmountable. If you feel that your money life is in chaos, and it seems impossible to get it under control, let alone bending it to your will, you are not alone. So what can be done to tame the wild bronco ride of variable income? Well, you need to turn your variable income into stable income. If only it were as easy as waving a magic wand! It isn't as easy as that, but you can break it into five steps:

1. Separate your business and personal accounts
2. All your income goes into the business account
3. Determine the variability of your income
4. Build a buffer in your business account
5. Pay yourself a stable income

So let's take a look at the steps.

# Separate your business and personal accounts
You may have already heard this. Separating your personal and business accounts is often touted as a good idea for IRS purposes, but I'd like to talk about another reason that is more relevant here - when you separate your personal money from your business money, you can get clarity. When all the business money is in one place you can see much more clearly how your business is really doing. And you can more easily budget your personal money if it is isolated from the fluctuations of the business. And that is the key here for those with variable income. You want to *isolate* the variability in one place.

# All your income goes into the business account
Once you have separated the two accounts, then you need to make sure that all of your income goes into your business account. Again, we're striving to isolate that variable income, so it is easier to understand it and manage it.

# Determine the variability of your income
Now that you have clarity between your personal money and your business money, you can use that clarity to really understand the variability of your income situation. For those of you with some variability, I suggest you look back at your income for the past 6 months. If you have extreme variability or seasonal variability, like realtors or owners of construction businesses, it is probably best to look at the last 12 months of income. List your income for the six months, and find these numbers:
- Highest Month
- Lowest Month
- The average of all the months (add them together and divide by the number of months you gathered

Now you have a bit of an idea of how much your business income really varies. Now, just because these were your numbers for the last few months doesn't mean that is what will happen in the next six months, but you're not looking for a perfect number here. You're just trying to get an idea of the ebb and flow of your business.

# Build a buffer in your business account
And the reason you are trying to figure that out is because you are going to use that information to build an Income Buffer. An Income Buffer is a small packet of money that allows you to even out the income you send to your personal account. That money will help you stay out of debt in the low months, and keep you from overspending in the flush months. So lets say your lowest month was $2000, your highest was $5000, and your average was $3500. You want to shoot for sending $3500 to your personal account every month, no matter how good or bad your revenue was this month. The difference between your lowest number and your average is $1500, so now you know that you need to build a buffer of at least $1500 to survive a low month of $2000 without reducing your personal spending.

You can open a separate account if you like, to start saving for that buffer. You may find that you need to save for it over time, especially if you are currently in a low ebb. But keep at it, and you will be able to save it over time. 

# Pay yourself a stable income
Here is the good part! When you've built that Buffer, you can start using it to stabilize your income. Let's say the next month, you make $3000. You'll pull $500 from your income buffer so that you can still pay yourself $3500. If the next month you make $4200, you can put all but $3500 of it back into your Income Buffer.

Now that you have a stabilized income, starting budget your personal expenses becomes so much easier!
