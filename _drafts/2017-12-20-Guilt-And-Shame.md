Do you feel guilty about your money past? Perhaps you've made a bad investment, or haven't invested at all. Maybe you trusted someone stole money from you, or you have a spending addiction. Whatever it is, we all have times that we have made bad decisions involving money, and that can lead to all sorts of negative emotions -- guilt, anger, betrayal, shame, and more. What's worse, over time it can leave you feeling in doubt of your own ability to manage money.

You are not alone! Most people have a bad story involving money. My personal story is actually rather average. My father made pretty good money all throughout my childhood, but neither of my parents were really good at managing money, so I felt all through my childhood that even though we were middle class, it always felt like we were one disaster away from total financial devastation. That fostered a lasting feeling of insecurity that I have spent most of my adult life trying to create a perfectly secure environment around me. In the small things, I'm spontaneous (friends might call me "random"), but in the large things I am **very** conservative. I started saving for retirement early by saving into my very first 401(k) and starting a Roth IRA as soon as I had my first job. Investing may seem very risky to many people, but I saw it as a way to make sure that I never ended up depending on a by-no-means guaranteed social security check in my old age. I knew that if I invested early in relatively risky stocks, I would have time to recover from market downturns.

That all may seem fine, but I did it to the exclusion of other parts of my life. I was so scared of losing that ability to save, that I stayed in jobs long after they had ceased to be a challenge, or made me happy. I stayed in personal relationships because they were a good bet financially (well, it's never that simple, but it was certainly a factor). So my life got pretty far out of balance for a lot of years. I've made changes to try to counteract it, but like many things, it's a work in progress. 

And I do feel guilty. I also feel sad, like I lost so many years being scared. And a bit angry at myself for not being more true to myself. I think I will always struggle with finding the balance of too stodgy and too reckless. 

# What should we do about our guilt and shame?
I first want to make sure that you honor your feelings. So often, we push away our negative feelings, because they are unpleasant. But to truly savor the joys in life, it is necessary to be fully present when we are experiencing the negative. So before you do anything else, spend a few moments just sitting with your feelings. What are those feelings? When you contemplate them, do other feelings wash over you, too? Or maybe memories come back to you? Sometimes it is helpful to journal this experience, so you can give physicality to the emotions. You may find that journaling (like the [Five Whys]({% post_url 2017-11-15-The-Five-Whys %}) exercise) helps you dig deeper into your past experiences.

It is important to feel your feelings, but you can then harness them to make positive changes in your life. I like to reframe my negative emotions about money -- they are trying to send up a red flag that your finances are not in balance with your values. If you see the red flags, you can change your behaviors. Even small changes can make a huge difference in your life overall.
