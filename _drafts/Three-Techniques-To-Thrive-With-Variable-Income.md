My money story has been fraught with wrong turns, struggles, and poor choices. In particular, I had written a money story a long time ago as a child, that financial insecurity was to be avoided at all costs. If I had a choice before me and one would make me happy, and the other would make me feel safe about money, I chose safe every time. That was a story I had to change to take the next step in my money life. But that is not what this article is about. This is about what I learned when I started my own business. And that is this: If I thought managing my money was hard when I had a stable paycheck, try doing it with variable income!

When I was budgeting with a stable salary, I had to deal with varying expenses, nasty surprises, and changing priorities all the time. But when I became a small business owner, everything became variable, both coming in, and going out. I didn't know how much money I was going to have to even budget with, so how could I make decisions at all?

This is the complex realm of variable income, and it can seem insurmountable. If you feel that your money life is in chaos, and it seems impossible to get it under control, let alone bending it to your will, you are not alone. So what can be done to tame the wild bronco ride of variable income?
