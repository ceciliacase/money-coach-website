As I have been working with the great people at [Debt Payoff Planner](http://debt-payoff-planner.com), we have been having fun looking through data. One thing they pointed out to me was some interesting statistics relating to family/friend loans. Often these loans are from a parent, and something that surprised me a bit, they often seem to have an interest rate associated with them. So Mom (or Dad) is charging people for their loans, which I found really surprising. And do you want to know who charges more, Mom or Dad?

Maybe you guessed it, maybe not! Mom charges more!


When you have a loan from family, when should you pay it off?
