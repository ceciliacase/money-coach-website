It’s been a magical and miraculous 2018, and I wanted to thank you again for your assistance in my financial make-over. As a single, self-employed woman, I’ve always struggled with my finances and balancing a budget. Now I love budgeting and keeping track of my money with YNAB! I separated my business and personal accounts. I learned how to budget money in my business account to pay myself a salary on the first of every month, and I have money growing in my savings, retirement account, and set aside for my quarterly taxes. My credit card is paid off in full each month. The most amazing and magical gift was paying my student loans off in full. A tremendous weight has been lifted from my shoulders. It feels amazing to have this kind of financial stability for the first time in my life! I’ve healed deep family wounds around money. I’m very grateful for your time, expertise and coaching to master YNAB, and being an integral part of my miraculous financial transformation.
