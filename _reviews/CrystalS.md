I have been in the financial industry for over 15 years now doing everything from credit cards to mortgages to underwriting, so I have always felt like a had a good grasp on my own finances and what I thought was budgeting. When I realized I was drowning in my debt and was barely living paycheck to paycheck, I reached out.

Cecilia and I have been working together on healing my relationship with money for a few months now. At first, I was extremely excited to dive right into the lessons and budgeting portion. But quickly felt overwhelmed when I realized my grasp on my own finances was barely hanging by a string. Having weekly coaching sessions with Cecilia has not only helped my anxieties and frustrations but has also helped me get some clarity on how deeply rooted this is.

Cecilia’s patience and understanding to my personal situation is beyond words. In addition to encouraging conversations, she takes the time to acknowledge the “win” in situations that have gotten the best of me. She also makes sure to explain things in a way that I make sense to me. Trying to over 30 years of bad habits and rocky relationships with money is going to be a bit of a rocky road, but I am feeling 100% confident having Cecilia by my side.

I would recommend this program to anyone at any level. Whether you are just starting your financial journey in life or you think you are a seasoned financial veteran like I thought. It has been extremely beneficial to me so far, (not just because I have been able to pay off 3 debts so far) and I am looking forward to the rest of the journey.
