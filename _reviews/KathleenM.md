I have great news!! I opened up all my accounts to my new husband and showed him all my hard work with the budget!! He is very relieved I finally have a system and I seem to know what I am doing. He was so impressed he is considering moving all his financial tracking over too! 

And together we have sat down with each of the children and walked them through YNAB for their personal use and it is now a requirement to have their budgets up to date and maintained before receiving monthly allowances!! This is moving exactly how I hoped and it is such a relief to finally know what I am talking about and have an intuitive system that makes it easy for the process to continue.

It feels like I am in a great spot and this experience has literally been life changing.
